scelerare: because to touch a corpse was pollution.

non . . . manat, ‘ no sti-anger to thee did Troy bear me,
nor flows this blood from lifeless stock.' This seems the
best and simplest interpretation of these lines. Conington,
however, would supply externus with cruor, ‘ nor is this the
blood of a stranger,' and it must be confessed that ‘this
is the blood of a man, not of a stock,’ seems rather a weak
remark. Non negatives the whole sentence. Tibi, dependent
on externum. Notice the ending composed of two disyllables,
only permitted when the preceding word is a monosyllable.
Cf. 1. 207 haud mora, nautae.

44. This line it was that compelled the great preacher
and reformor, Fra Girolamo Savonarola (1452—1498)‚ to give
up the world for religion.

crudeles . . . avarum: the country is blamed for the
sin of its king.

45—6. For Polydorus see Proper Names. There were many
legends concerning his fate. Vergil has adopted that fol-
lowed by Euripides in the Hecuba.

hic . . . acutis, ‘here an iron crop of darts pierced and
covered me, and grew up in sharp javelins.' Vergil has
inverted the natural order. It was with sharp javelins
that Polydorus was killed, and these after his death turned
into a crop of shoots.

iaculis is to be taken as ablative of attendant circum-
stances, not as dative, although the English idiom requires
‘in,’ which is better suited to translate the latter.

47. ancipiti . . . formidine, ‘with doubt and fear.’ The
adjective is really passive in meaning, the doubt being
caused by the fear.

mentem . . . pressus. Mentem may be taken as accusative
of respect, but it is more probable that it is an accusative
of the object after a passive or middle verb. The Roman
poe-ts, and Tacitus among prose writers, retained the diiect
object with passive words mainly when used in a reflexive
sense. The object then expresses either (1) a part of the
body or mind ; (2) a thing worn. This book contains
various instanceS, which will be noticed as they occur, and
collected in an Appendix.

48. ‘ My hair stood up. and my voice clave to my jaws.'
The same verse occurs Book ii. 1. 774. Compare Job iv. 15,
‘Then a spirit passed before my sace ; the hair of my flesh
stood up,'and xxix. 10, ‘Their tongue cleaved to the roof
of their mouth?
