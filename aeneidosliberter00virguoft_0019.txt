the line is divided into six feet, of which the first four
may be indifferently dactyls 4- ψ υ) 01· spondees (— -J,
the fifth a dactyl, very rarer a spondee. and the last

‘terra procul vastis colitur Mavortffi czsmpss' ql. 13} ;
οι· weak, i. e. after the trochee in the third foot, e.g.
‘obstupui steterintque comaett v} saueibushaessi‘t ' (l. 48).
A less common caesura is in the fourth foot ; eg.

‘ qud Phoebus vocet errantes Ι iubeatque reverts³ (l. 101‘).

This caesura is frequently found with elision at the end
of the third foot ; e. g.

‘sintel Ρὲθζ, et longum Andromaehao teztentur amorem'
