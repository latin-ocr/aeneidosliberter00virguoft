INTRODUCTION 15

Myself Ι saw him of our folk two hapless bodies take
In his huge hand, whom straight he fell athwart a stone

As ffieiljgehlg' lay upon his baek3 I saw the threshold
Witlsslglgguted blood, Ι saw him grind each bloody drip—
1 sagutlglehjrgikiits amidst his teeth all warin and quiver-

He pffffedtfflereforffi for never might Ulysses bear such ill,
Nor was he worser than himself in such a pinch be·
But Ξνῗέη. with victual satiate, deep sunk in sleep, his
Fell oiacliis breast, and there he lay enormous through
8110111138ᾶὲἓέ gore amidst his sleep‚ with gobbets of the
Andnllgllngled blood and Win03 then we sought the great
Gods with prayer
And. l(lrew the lots, and one and all crowded about him
Andtbglgd out with a sharpened pike the eye that used
Enortlzoffsrklonely ’neath his brow o'erhanging grim and
As gea-5213 shield of Argolis, or Phoebus' lamp on high3
And so our murdered fellows’ ghosts avenged we joyously.’

Other versions by Vioam, Ogflby, ancl Trapp cannot be
quoted here. Of Stanyhurst’s translat-ion into English
hexameters, one line is worth preserving. It is meant to
adapt sound to sense.

‘Exoritur clamorque virum clangorque tubarum,'
appears in English dress as
‘The townsmen roared, the trump tara-‘cantara rattled '

(quoted in Collins’ Vergil).

Of prose versions it is only necessary to mention as
excellent those by A. Hamilton Bryce, LL.D.—p1·0bably
the best—Mackail, Professor Conington, and by Lee and
Lonsdale.
