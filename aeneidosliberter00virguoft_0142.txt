132 VERGIL’S AENEID 111

vento is an instrumental ablative. Kennedy prefers to
take it as equivalent to Ferte ventum viae facilem, ‘Send a wind
favourable to our voyage? N otice the triple alliteration.

530. portusque patescit, ‘and a harbouropens to our
eyes.’ This is the opposite of the phrase we have already
had in l. 411 rarescent claustra Pelori. As the ficet draws
nearer, the entrance of the harbour appears to become wider.
The port meant is the Portus Veneris in Calabria, in the
*Heel’ of Italy, a common starting-point for a voyage to
Greece. The neighbouring place was called Castrum
Miner rae.

531. The genitive Minervae may depend either on templum
or arca the former being the more likely, as the latter would
imply that Arx Minervae was another name for the place, and
of this there is no evidence. The temple was traditionally
founded by Idomeneus.

533. ‘The haven is cui-ved into a bow by the eastern
waves.' Observe the use of ab with the ablative of the
instrument. It is due to the fact that the waves are
personified and looked upon as the agent. The opposite
construction is found, e. g. Juvenal speaks of columns broken
assiduo lectore, ‘by a never-ceasing reader,' where all idea of
personality has disappeared‚ the idea being merely that
of constant reading. Euroo is a rare adjective ΖΕοο, which
some have read here. Owing to the apparent contradiction
between this line and the next, in which Vergil speaks
of a barrier of rocks protecting the harbour, Page would
translate ‘curves into a bay away from the east winds.'

534. obiectae . ..cautesz literally ‘rocks cast in the way‚’
i.e. a rocky bar.

535. ᾕρεε latet: ipse, the portus. There is no real incon-
sistency between latet and patescit. The harbour is really
rutil-ed behind its rocky barrier, but on a near approach an
entrance is seen, which becomes wider as the ships draw
nexu-er. A reading patet has been proposed to meet the
supposed inconsistency.

gemino . . . , ‘a double wall of embattled crags sends
its arms down ⁷ ; yemino muro and bracchia really describe the
same thing7 a ridge of rocks extending in front of the harbour
from either side.

536. refugit. ‘the temple recedes from the shore? A
(lescriptive phrase expressing the gradual diminution in
height of the ridge on which the temple stands as it
approaches the shore. The nearer the Trojans approach,
the further back the temple seems to stand.
