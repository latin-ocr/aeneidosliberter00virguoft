 

NOTES 101

Sidgwick prefers to take exposcere pacem with votis precibusque
only, and to supply with (ινηιὶε another verb z ‘to have
their way.' This interpretation will not commend itsclf
to many.

262. sint: subjunctive, because the clauso is virtually in
Oratio Obliqua. The direct speech was exposcere pacem, sire
clecw sunt, seu . . . volucres. For dirae obscenaeque see 11. 235,
241, notes.

264. ⁴ CaHs on the great gods and enjoins due offerings.’

magna is emphatic 3 gods powerful enough to overrule
the Harpies.

indicere is a technical term of Roman life, an instance
of Vergil’s love for bringing in contemporary customs, and
applying them, regardless of chronology, to the heroic age.
Indico = ‘ to proclaini publicly‚' and is repeatedly used with
concilium: ⁴ a meeting of councillors' ; supplicatio? a public
prayer or solemnity’3 comitia= ‘an election’3 bellum: ‘war';
serrorum numerum et pondus argenti, of sumptuary laws, 810.

266. placidi: apparently=placati‚ ‘appeased.'

tum, ‘then he bade* tear the cable from the shore, and
uncoil and ease the sheets!

267. rudentes. What Vergil here calls rudentes (a word
used of any of the lighter cordage of a ship’s rigging) arc
obviously the pedes 01· ‘sheets’ These were ropes fastened
to the lower corners of a square sail, in order to set it to
the wind, one to larboard, one to starboard. These sheets,
when not in use, were furled into a coil, and must be
unfurled, and then braced so as to enable the sai] to catch
the wind. Excussos refers to the unfurling; lua-are to the
Ietting out of the sheet, which would be necessary to catch
the full force of the wind (Dictiomcry of szlz'rszcitiess

268. undis: ablative of space over which. See 11. 124
and 204, pclayo.

269. †vocabat is to be joined with ventus as well as with
metm-nator, but agrees with the latter substantive only. This
is usually only the case when joint action on the part of
the subjects is not intended to be expressed5 but here the
opposite is the case, and vocabant (read in some inferior
manuscripts] would be more regular.

270. ⁴ Woody Zacynthus-² is a reminiscence of Homer, as
is the practice of leaving a vowel short before ε. Such

· words as Zacynthos, smdraqdus, sciurus, Scamander, cannot

otherwise be introduced into hexameter verse.
271. For names see Proper Names. ‘ Neritus with tower-
ing rocks ’ cannot be the mountain, but must be an island.
