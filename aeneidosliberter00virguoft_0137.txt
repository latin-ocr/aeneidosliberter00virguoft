yield in honour (i. e. in gifts) to her husband? So Page,
who quotes instances in favour of honor =⁴honorary gift?
(2) With Ascanius as subject, ‘Nor does he fail in beauty‚'
i. e. he does justice to the mantle ; the change of subject is
opposed to this. On the whole, Page’s version gives the
best and most obvious sense, but the reading honori having
better support, I am inclined to follow Conington, and to
translate ‘Nor falls she short in the task of honouring,’

participle of esse. Compare deinceps reyes =⁶the following
kings.’

490. ‘Even so his eyes⁷ his hands, his face he moved!
Page and Sidgwick prefer to take ferebat = ⁴ he showed.'

ille is not emphatic, but denotes a change of subject.

491. pubesceret. The protasis si vireret is left to be under-
stood3 the omission hints pathetically at Andromache’s
overpowering emotion.

492. obortis. The ob signifies an obstruction. Compare
obducere ε ‘draw over' : obicere = ‘throw in the way ': oblo-
qui = ⁴ speak against ' ε obstruere = ⁴ block up.’ &a

493. ⁵ Live happy, as men whose fate is fulfilled.'

vivite felices: a common formula in saying farewell.
