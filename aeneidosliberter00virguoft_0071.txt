† clenotes dzssfferent readings&

1. res Asiae, ‘the power of Asia.' The phrase is an
cxaggeration, because the kingdom of Troy, which is what
is meant, cannot have contained more than the north-west
coast of Asia Minor. Probably Vergil intentionally chose
the expression to mark the difference between Troy’s power
of old and its ubter destruction. The contrast is well
expressed in Conington’s translation:

‘When harsh Omnipotence had brought
The power of Asia’s kings to nought.'

2. immeritam, ‘undeserving'3 that is to say, of such
a fate. ‘Innocent„' ‘guilflessff The people of Troy had had
no share in the sin of Paris, yet they suffered for it.

visumazrisum est, ‘ it seemed good.’ Vergil frequently
omits the auxiliary.

superis has two meanings; (Γ) the gods above [as
gel-em (2) men on the earth, as opposed to the dead
eneath.
