100 VERGIL’S AENEID 111

it of the readiness of the winds to come at the Trojans'
call.

254. Notice the accusative Italiam, without a preposition,
a construction usually confined to the names of towns and
small islands.

255. datam: i. e. ‘by destiny.'

256. ‘ Before monstrous hunger and your murderous
wrong to us constrain your jaws to gnaw and devour your
tames?

iniuria. caediS, ‘the wrong consisting in your attempted
murder of us.’ The genitive is that of kind or contents
(Roby)‚ and is often equivalent to an apposition.

caedis: an angry exaggerati0n3 for the Trojans had not
been able to injure the Harpies, although they had tried.

257. ambesas . . . absumere = ambedere et absumere. For
this use of amb [ἀμφί], which is found in composition only,
compare amplecti, conputare, anquirere.

subigat: subjunctive of purpose. Antequam, referring
to future time, is generally used with the future perfect 01·
present subjunctive; the former indicating mere temporal
force, the latter final.

mensas. This was an old prophecy. although no one
but Vergil has placed it in the mouth of the Harpy. It was
ascribed either to Jupiter at Dodona, Venus, or the Ery‘
threan Sibyl. The prophecy was fulfilled in the seventh
book, where the Trojans are represented as eating off cakes
instead of plates‚ and then as eating the cakes too. There-
upon Ascanius in boyish glee cried out, ‘Look, we eat our
tables too! ’ and the prophecy was fulfilled. The ancients
seem to have felt no incongruity in allowing the gods'
oracles and commands to be fulfflled, by some quibble‚ in
the letter only. Compare the story of Cyrus and the pro-
phecy that he should be king, told by Herodotus.

259. Notice the alliteration, ‘ but my comrades' blood ran
cold with sudden terror, and curdled.'

sociis: dative of person intmested, where genitive
might have been expected.

260. Page is clearly right in taking armis and pacem both
with exposcere. At first the Trojans thought of demanding
peace, i.e. liberty to seed undisturbed, at the point of the
sword; but after the deliverance of the oracle they were
fain to demand peace, i. e. security from the threats of the
Hal-pies, with vows and entreaties.

261. exposcere isto be treated as almost an example of
zeugma, being strictly applicable to precibus, less so to armis.
