578.gThere are various legends as to the identity of the
giant beneath Aetna. Generally he was called Typhon or
Typhoeus, whom Vergil (Aen. ix. 716) puts beneath Inarime
or Pithecusa, as did Lucan—but Callimachus calls him
Briareus. Valerius Flaccus describes Neptune as forcing
Typhoeus under the 383 and piling Aetna and its cities upon
his face (ii. 24—33). So in the Middle Ages the Ostrogothic
king Theodoric was said to be buried under the volcano of
Lipari, which was known as ‘Theodoric's Hell!

semustum is the best spelling. If semiusfum is read, it
must be scanned semJ‘ustum, as abiete = absste, and parietibus =
parjetibus.

fulmine: hurled by Jove.

580. ruptis . . . caminis: i e. fresh mouths or channels
for the fire are burst from time to time through the mass of
the mountain. Apparently Vergil means to imply that it
was not until the giant was placed beneath Aetna that it was
a volcano, at all events an active one, and that the fire was
the result of the fulmen which struck Enceladus down.

581. fessum . . . latus is copied by Val. Flaccus in his imita-
tion (ii. 32} sesso dum pectore molem Commoret. So intremere
omnem M zcmzcre Trinacriam becomes Tunc omnis anhelat Trinacria.

mutet: the subjunctive is due to the fact that fama est
introduces Oratio Obliqua.

582. subtexere, ‘shrouds heaven in smoke‚' the smoke
being as it were a curtain which hides the sky. subtexere, lit.
= ‘ to weave below.'

583. †noctem: accusative of duration of time. Other MSS.
read nocte illa.

monstra. refers, no doubt. 10 the rumblings of the
mountain.

584. perferimus: per is a strengthening affix = ‘to the
end‚' ‘throughout'

det. · indirect question after videmus.

585. ‘ For 111818 were neither starry fires, nor a sky
gleaming with starlit 3118811 but clouds on the dark face of
heaven, &and timeless night hid the moon in da1·.’kness
aethra is said by Servius⁰ 10 be different from aether and
1ο imply‘ the bl ightness of the sky‚' as opposed to the mere
8181118111 of the aether.
