76 VERGIL’S AENEID 111

78. fessos expresses both the weariness of the voyage and

the disappointment experienced in Thrace.
portu: probably ablative of place, although it is not
impossible to regard it as instrumental.

79. veneramur: not as in 1. 34 of worship and prayer,
but of admiration and awe.

80. idem, ‘king and priest in one.' In early times the
chief, and even the father of each household, possessed
priestly power as well as parental authority. So in primitive
states the king was also high priest‚ as were the Roman
Enipei-ors, many of whom, and above all Augustus, wished
to keep up the externa] signs and names of earlier days.
In Rome, after the expulsion of the kings, the priestly
power was bestowed on the pontifex ‘mamimus and rex sacri-
ficulus, while at Athens the king Archon was the chief
priest and superintended prosecutions in which religion
was involved.

rex . . . hominum is a Homeric expression [ἅναξ ἀνδρῶν]
81. redimitus tempora: see l. 47, and Appendix.
lauro: the laurel was sacred to Apollo.

82. † agnovit: perfect of instantaneous momentary action
2‘1·ecognized at once.’ Another reading is the present
«quescit.

83. hospitio: ablative of cause, ‘from a guest-connection ’
<R0by). To clasp the right hand was a pledge of friendship.

84. saxo . . . structa. vetusto is apparently a variation of
vetusta templa structa samo. Servius declares that it refers to
the fact that owing to the freedom of the island from
earthquakes the original stone of the temple had never
needed replacing. Saxo is ablative of material.

venerabar is said by Conington to have here the force
of entreating, which it certainly bears in 1. 34. This
explanation will suit well the direct words of prayer which
follow. but it is doubtful whether templa ... venerabar could bear
the meaning ‘ Ι was praying to the temple.’ It seems better
to take the word as in 1. 79, not of prayer, but of reverential
awe, a feeling which (as Page well says) would ‘find
expression in the prayer which follows?

85. propriam: from its original meaning, ‘one’s own,’
eomes to signify ‘perpetuaL’ ‘abiding’ which is its meaning
here. Vergil uses it in a similar sense with reference to the
home of the Trojans in 1. 167 liae nobis propriae sedes. So
Lucilius says that nothing proprium in life is given to
mortals. For its usez‘one’s own ' compare the French

propre.
