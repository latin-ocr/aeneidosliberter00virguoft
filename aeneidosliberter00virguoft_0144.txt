134 VERGIL’S AENEID 111

546. ‘And in accord with Helenus' bidding, the bidding
he gave as most weighty, we duly offer the prescribed
sacrifices to Argive Jun0.’ Notice the attraction of the
superlative into the relative clause--maximis praeceptis quae
Helenus dederat.

547. Argivae: emphatic=Juno the supporter of the
Greeks, our enemy.

adolemus: the uses of this word are various. Conington
nEcI. viii. 66³ proposes two explanations. (1) The word is
connected with addesco, and means ‘to cause to grow‚'
from which comes the meaning ‘to honour' especially by
sacrifice, and finally ‘to burn? (2) It means ‘ to smell' or
‘to make to smell,’ hence to burn, especially in sacrifice,
and finally ‘to burn 111 honour of.' As instances of these
uses we may quote Ecl. viii. 66 Verbemcsqne adole, where
the meaning is ‘burn’ in a magio charm3 Aen. i. 704 flammis
adolere. penates Here itzcwqere, ‘to honour by increase.’
The meaning is similar 111 Book vii. 71 castis adolet dum
altaria taedis. Other authors use the word in the sense
of offering in sacrifice, e. g. Tac. Au. xiv. 30 cruore captivo
adolere aras, and of burning generally, e. g. ‘nt leves stipulae demp-
tis adolentur aristis. Adolescorc 15 used. in a similar sense in
Georq. iv. 379 adolescunt {quibus arae.

548. ordinez‘in order due'; one ceremony following
another as was¹ prescribed. So er ordine.

549. This line 15 difficult, ancl several views are taken
as to its meaning. (1) Conington—following Henry—under-
stands· it to mean that the horns or tips of the yards are
turned towards the land, because, as the wind 6011165 from
the shore, and the ship's head is pointed seaward, the sails
will fill out towards the sea, and the antemnae which restrain
them will point—one at least—straight to land. The objection
to this explanation is the difficulty of understanding terrae
with obvertunt, and the over-refinement of meaning, for it is
surely almost absurd to speak of ‘turning the 1101115 to land’
when the idea to be eonveyed is that of sailing out into the
open3 (2) Page translates ‘We set square (to the wind] the
1101115 of the sail-clad ya1·ds‚' understanding vento. Papillon
and Sidgwick accept this explanation, which is certainly
natural and sensible3 (3) If it be objected that rento 15
110 easier to understand than terrae, we may say that ob 15
quite indefinite, expressing merely the notion of ‘opposite’
and translate ‘turn in the direction of our course.' Then
it will be necessary to take cornua relatarum antemnarum as=
vela, which is quite in Vergil’s manner. Translate ‘We turn
