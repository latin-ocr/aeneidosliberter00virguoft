pandit: frequently used of oracles; cf. 1. 252.
480. pietate: this—filiai affection—was the chief charac-
teristic of Aeneas, who even speaks of himself as pius.
quid . . ,ἲ ‘why proceed I further, and by my speech
delay the rising wind ἶ) '

481. demoror: a strained use, as though the winds were,

kept waiting by Helenus’ farewell. So in ii. 647-8 Anchises
says annos (ῑευιονον, ‘I keep waiting the years that would
hurry me to the g1·ave.' Compare Valerius Flaccus, i. 350,
351 Zephyrumque ratemque morantes solverat cmzplexas.

482. digressu . . . suprem0‚ ‘a parting for ever‚’ as they
could never hope to meet again.

483. ‘Brings robes brocaded with thread of gold, and a
Phrygian mantle for Ascanius?

picturatas = pictas acu, i. e. ‘ brocaded,’ the pattern being
made in the weaving with gold thread.

sumeqmen (or subtemen) ε( that which is woven in‚’ ‘the
woof of a web.’ From this it comes to be used of thread
or yflrn, and is especially applied to the ‘threads of the
Fates!

484. Phrygiam = ‘ embroidered: distinguished from pictu-
ratas by having the pattern worked in the eloth 3 needlework
opposed to tapestry.

The chlamys was a Grreek mantle with two corners which
were fastened in front by a brooch or buckle⁷ the longest
part hanging down behind to the knees.

†nec cedit honori. This expression has caused much
difficulty, and it cannot be said that any final decision as to
its meaning has yet been reached. The MSS. vary between
honori and honore. Taking the former reading, we have the
following explanations proposed: (Ι) ‘Nor does she fall
short of her husband's bounty’ (Heyne); the objection to
this is the difficulty of understanding ‘Heleni.’ (2) ‘Nor
does she fall short of the honour due to Ascanius,' which
cannot but seem very forced. (3) With chlamys as subject,
‘ Nor does it fall short of the beauty of the picturatas restes ¹ ;
the change of subject is against this. (4) ‘Nor does she flag
in the work of honour-ing him ’ (Conington) = nec cessat
honorare; this use requires support. (5) Honori may be
used in the sense of the ⁴ dignity' of her husband (Nettle-
ship). Honor is not uncommonly used of an official position,
eg. summus honor =‘consul‘; this use seems hardly suited
to Epic verse. The other reading, honore, has less manuscript
support, and is less probable as being more obvious. With
this reading we have two alternatives: (Ι) ‘Nor does she
