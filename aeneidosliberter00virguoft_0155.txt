N OTES 145

643. ad litora: as in l. 556, ‘along the shore?

vulgo, ‘on all sides ’= passim.

644. Cfrclopes, scanned as a Greek noun. For Cyclopas see

645. i.e. Three months had passed: the moon’s horus
had waxed aud waned thrice.

‘And now three moons their sharpened horns renew.'—

Dryden.

646. cum vitam. . . traho, ‘ since I have been dragging
out my life? The present may be compared with the present
with iamcluclimz, &c.‚ used to express duration of time still
eontinuing. So in French with depuis and il y (ι . . . qne.
Cum = per quod tempus.-Sidgwick. Τι’(ιΙιο differs from asso
or duco in implying that the time dragged ontis a time of
unpleasantness.

647. lustra. = ‘lairs.'

ab rupe may be taken with the following Cyclopas, not
with prospicio, because Homer described the Cyclops as
living οιι the mountains, = ‘011 the 1·ock.' It seems, how-
ever, more natural to suppose that Achaemenides had
climbed a hill in search of help or some way of escape, and

l. 403 Phryqicz arma tremescunt.

649. infelicem: used, as Page points out, of trees whose
fruit is not good for food. So (ἴθυνα. ii. 1. 314 iiifelir oleaster: -
Ecl. v. l. 37 infelix lolium, although the latter also implies
unfruitfulness.

lapidosaque corna: these words occur Geor9. ii. 1. 34,
where lapidosa corna are described as blushing on the
prune, i. e. by the process of grafting.

650. vulsis, ‘ hei-bs feed me with roots uptorn‚’ i.e. aster
tearing up the hei-bs Ι eat the roots. Compare l. 27 ruptis
radicibus arbos vellitur.

652. fuisset. The mood is due to the fact that the sen-
tence is in Virtual Oratio Obliqua. Achaemenides said to
himself, Huic me, quascumque suerit, Adclicczm, and the future
perfect regularly becomes the pluperfect subjunctive in
Oratio Obliqua. Compare ii. 94 Et me. fors si qua hdisset,
. . . {omisi ultorem, where tulisset represents tulerit. So ii.
189, c.

653. addixi. This is the technical word for adjudging
a debtor to his creditor as slave, also used of those who sold
themselves as gladiators. The addictus was, however, higher
