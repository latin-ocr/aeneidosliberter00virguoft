with the sea. Conington asserts that the ancients conceived
the gods of the sea to be of that colour.

432. canibus is merely a variety of luporum, l. 428.

resonantia. saxa. So Milton, Pccradise Lost, ii τ
‘The hoarse Trinacrian shore)

433. ‘Moreover, if there be any foresight in Helenus, if
any faithfulness in his prophecy, if Apollo fills his mind
with truth.’ prudentia refers more to the subjective, fides
to the objective side of the prophecy. That is to say,
prudentia lays more stress on Helenus’ knowledge, fides on
the truth it contains and the confidence it begets. Si
expresses not so much a supposition as a fact. ‘Since what
Ι say is true. therefore pay heed to this one warning.'

434. veris : neuter. This use is uncommon with the adjec-
tive, except with the nominative or accusative. Usually, if
an adjective in an oblique case might be either masculine οι·
neuter, it is more in accordance with Latin usage to take it
as the former.

435. illud refers to what follows. It is very common in
Latin prose to begin a sentence with illud, which is explained
in the following sentence. So here it refers to the prayers
and sacrifice to Juno, ll. 437, 438. Pro =‘ instead of! Unus
is frequently joined with a superlative or its equivalent:
e.g. iustissimus mzzcs = ‘ the most just of all: Unus maxime ex
omnibns. &Q

436. Take iterumque iterumque with monebo.

437. In this and the next line the emphasis lies on the
first word. ‘Gi-eat Juno’s deity worship thou first with
prayer z to Juno gladly chant thy vows, and by thy suppliant
offer-ings o'ercome the powerful queen.’

primum: adverbially, not with numen.

438. cane. For the word’s use in sacred matters, above

all in the chanting of oracular prophecy, see l. 155, note.
libens (or libens merito, abbreviated, L. MA: a constant

formula in paying a vowx e.g. Iovi libens meritoque ritulor,

Plaut. Pers. 2. 3. 1. Very frequent in inscriptions (L. and S.).

439. supera: a strong word well suited to the violent
hatred of Juno, which was to be borne down by prayer and
sacrifice :

‘And vanquish heaven’s imperial queen with prayer? )
(Pitt.
For donis some MSS. give rotis, no doubt on account of
the phrase, Totum libens solz-it.

440. fines: accusative of motion towards, without a pre-

position as often in verse.
