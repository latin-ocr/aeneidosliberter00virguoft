NOTEs 141

605. ‘Scatter my Ilmbs over the waves, or drown me in
the mighty sea.’ Que is disjunctive, for two ways of killing
Achaemenides are suggested, either to tear him piecemeal‚
or to drown him at once.

606. Observe the hiatus pereo hominum: such a hiatus is not
uncommon at the caesura, and must here be considered as
due to the pause after pereo. The tense pereo instead of the
future or future perfect expresses the speaker's expectation
of immediate death.

hominum: opposed to his fear of being eaten by the
Cyclops, ll. 626—7.

607. ‘So he spake, and grasping our knees and at our knees
grovelling, he clung.' The repetition os yenua . . . qenz'bus is
said by Page to express the. earnestness of the petition.
Genibus, not with haerebat, but as ablative of place with
volutans. The latter verb must be used intransitively‚ in
which sense it occurs in Ovid (Am. iii. 6. 45) of a river per
caca saza volutans. Other participles used in this way are
rersans, vehens, volvens <Gema i. 163), movens, e. g. res moventes:
movables. Roby connects this use of participles with the
passive use of the gerund.

608. †qai sit: not ‘who he is' (quis sit), but ‘what man
he is,’ adjectival not substantival. Some MSS. have quis.
Quis expects merely a name in answer, qui desires more
details.

sit: subjunctive as being a question in Oratio Obliqua.
Observe fari after hortatus. ⁴

609. deinde may be taken in two ways. (1) Most probably
it is out of place, and should be constructe-d withJaleri, ‘Next
to confess? Compare Book i. 195 rina bouus quae deinde cadis
onerarat Acestes. So sic deinde locutus2sz‘c locutus, deinde. δὶα.
(2 Take it with ayz'tet. Then the meaning is, ‘we bid him
tell us who he is, and of what lineage, and of the fortune
which has subsequently befallen him.’ Page's criticism that
‘unless you have some special fortune at or before your birth
it seems foolish to ask about your subsequent fortunes’ is
scarcely to the point. The questions asked were ‘Who are
you Ῥ ’ ‘What is your birth ἶ) ’ ⁴ What has been your fortune
since your birth ἰ) ’

610. pater: contrasted with the following iuveni.

611. praesenti pignore. Praesens- is apparently a financial
metaphor. Praesens pecunia: ‘ready cash ’- praesenti die clare
=‘in ready money.' So praesens poena: ‘immediate punish·
ment‚’ praesens supplicium:‘instant execution: The pledge
is immediate but implies future help.
