NOTES 137

569. adlabimur oris: cf. l. 131.

570. ‘ The haven is withdrawn from the winds' approach,
and of ample size itself.' Ab is to be taken as ‘ removed fron1,'
and not with immotus = ‘ unmoved by.' although, as we have
seen on l. 533, such a construction is not impossible. Vergil
has over-refined his expression, which in full would mn ab
accessu remorum remotus et ventis immotus, i. e. ⁴ removed from
the winds’ approach, and unstirred by the wind.'

571. ipse = the haven was satisfactory in itself, being both
calm and. large, but (sed) the neighbourhood of Aetna was
a disadvantage.

For horrificis compare l. 225 horrzfico lapsu. of the
Har-pies. The word is transitive and describes the effect
on the beholders.

ruinis : according to Sidgwiok means the discharges or
showers of matter thrown up. Page considers it to have a
double meaning, being used both of the fall of the showers,
and of the devastation caused by them. Conington points
out that the word is occasionally used of violent motion. It

572. interdum: followed by interdum in l. 575, ⁶ Now . . .

volcano. Observe the active force of prorumpit, an un- ⁴

common use.
573. ⁶ With eddies of pitchy smoke and glowing ashes?
574. globos flammarum. Vergil has already used these
words in Georqz'c i. 473, in a similar context, where he de-
scribes an eruption of Aetna.
sidera. lambit, ‘licks the stars,' a graphio exaggeration.
Vergil frequently uses sidera to express the sky. Lambit,
a similar metaphor to ‘tongues of fire.’
575. ‘Now cragS‚ the mountain’s severed entrails, it up-
heaves belching, and molten rocks rolls roal-ing to the sky.⁷
scopulos and viscera in apposition. Milton (Paradz'se
Losf, Book i) has various phrases which recall this passage,
and which were doubtless founded upon it, e. g. :
‘There stood a hill not far, whose grisly top
Belch'd fire and rolling smoke,’
and
‘Men . . . with impious hands
Rifled the bowels of their mother earth·
576. liquefactaque saxa: from Georqic i. 473. Page has
