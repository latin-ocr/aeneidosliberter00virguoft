receiving in succession‚ and is therefore appropriate, as
Aeneas saved from the sea was next to meet the Harpies;
but possibly there is a hint at the use of the word in
hospitable receptions3 Aeneas expected friendly treatment
after his sufferings, and met the Harpies.

stant, as often, is used for sunt, but implying greater
fixity. The word is appropriate here, as Strophades means
‘ the Floating Isles.'

211. insulae must be scanned ἳηειῖῖᾶε, the diphthong being
shortened before the followingi; this is a Greek custom
which Vergil has adopted. Compare I Ζῐῦ alm, Book v. 1. 261,
credimus an ρῑιῖ amant .? Ed. viii. l. 109.

212. Harpyiae: a Greek word [ἁρπάζωε ‘to snatch ']. In
Homer the Harpies occur merely as a personification of the
storm winds. but Vergil has followed the later Greek poet
Apollonius Rhodius, who represents them as half-human
monsters sent by the gods to avenge the sons of Phineus,
a Thracian king, whose eyes their father had put out.
Probably—if there is any rationalistic explanation of the
legend—it had its origin in some species of large bats.
Gibbon following Le Clerk suggests that the Harpies were
loeusts. In the British Museum is a monument known as
the ‘Harpy Tomb‚' from Xanthos in Lycia, (lating about
550 Β. c. It represents the Harpies-—half-bird‚ halfifemale
monsters-——carrying off female figures.

213. metu. Phineus was delivered from his tormentors
by Zetes and Calais, sons of the North Wind, who chased
the monsters to the Strophades. Valerius Flaccus, an
imitator both of Apollonius Rhodius and of Vergil (although
also a poet of no inconsiderable power] has described this
combat, which was an episode in the voyage of the Argo-
nauts in quest- of the Golden Fleece.

priores: i. e. Phineus' food.

214. ‘ Fouler than they no monster, more crue] no plague
and wrath of heaven rose from Stygian waves.'

215. Notice the boldness of the expression ira (lemn, the
unusual character of which is slightly modified by the use
of pestis. The Harpies being the visible sign of the gods'
anger, are called by Vergil their ‘wrath,' bodied forth in
material shape. It is possible however to take pestis el ἱνα
as a hendiadys, ‘the plague and wrath of heaven ' = ‘ heaven’s
plague sentin anger' (so Page). But the former explanation,
with its bold identification of concrete and abstract, is much
more in accordance with Vergil’s love for a new, even if
strained, expression.
