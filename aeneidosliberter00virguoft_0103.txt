away heaven with its rain ς the lightnings rent the clouds
with redoubled might?

involvo is a metaphor from wrapping up in clothes or
bandages. Southey has used the word in its literal sense,
‘In this mantle involve thy feet,’ by no means a happy

diceret, and Cicero fratres in suspicionem venerunt fanum expilasse
(Roby). l. 603 fatear petiisse.

202. nec neminisse=‘ and says that he does not remem-
ber.’ An affirmative verb such as ‹lz'cit must be supplied to
