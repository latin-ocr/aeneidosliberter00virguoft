68 VERGIL'S AENEID 111

36. visus is to be interpreted ‘ the portent,’ not the ‘sight‚’
i. e. it is used in the sense generally belonging to visum.

levarent: the omen was a heavy one 3 Aeneas prayed
for it to be made light, not (as Sidgwick translates) ‘to be
taken away.’ The omen was bound to have its result, but-
this by prayer to the gods might be made less crushing
than would otherwise be the case. To put away the omen
altogether was impossible, so Aeneas prays for his burden
to be lightened, not totally removed.

37. ‘But when with mightier effort I attack the spear
shafts a third time, and strain with knees pressed against
the sand.'

tertia is really equivalent to tertio, ιΙ make a third
attempt.'

hastilia: plural because the plant contained as many
boughs as were the spears which killed Polydorus.

38. adversae . . . harenae: literally, ‘the opposing sand.’
Dative after the ob in obluctor. Harena& refers to the tumulus.

39. eloquar an sileam?:‘shall Ι speak out or hold my
peace ‘? ' Direct double question with utrum omitted. The
phrase is a rhetorical device to draw the listener's attention
to what is to follow, by hinting at yet greater horrors.

lacrimabilis, ‘ a piteous groan.‘ Conington is inclined
to take the word in an active sense, on the analogy of pene-
trabilis, although, as he confesses, no example of this meaning
can be found. It is safer to treat the word as passive.

40. tumulo may be either ablative of place where, or
place whence, probably the latter. Prose would require
a preposition in either case.

† vox reddita. is rightly taken by Page as ‘an answering
voice⁷; answering, that is to say, either to Aeneas' act in
pulling, or to the expectation of some explanation which led
him to make a third attempt. The re in reddere frequently
has the meaning ‘as might have been expected‚’ ‘as was
due' Here it is probably connected with the transitive
use of the verb = ‘ to re-echo.’ Instead of acl aures, there is an
inferior reading, ad auraS, ‘to the air,’ i. e. a voice heard on
earth, although coming from within the ground.

41. Aenea: Greek vocative instead of the short Latin ‘a.’

parce is used with a slight difference of meaning in
this and the following line, ‘ spare the buried‚’ ‘ spare (i.e.
forbear) to defile thy pure hands.’

42. pias. The hands that had been so marked by kind
acts, such us the rescue of Anchises, should not descend to
the violation of a tomb.
