86 VERGIL'S AENEID III

145. flerat: the subjunctive is owing to the indirect
question dependent on veniam. Instead of quam some
manuscripts read quem, which is more in accordance with
the ordinary gender of finis, but Vergil makes the word
feminine frequently, e. g. Book ii. 1. 554; a use found also
oecasionally in Cicero and Livy.

laborum: genitive of the remoter object corresponding
to a prepositional phrase, very common with such words as
fuya = ‘ ssight from ’ ; imperium = ‘ command over’ ; opinio =
‘opinion concerning’ ; coniunctio: ² connexion with,' and the
adjectives dubius, anxius, incertus, trepidus, διο. ‘Whence
he bids us seek aid for our troubles, and whither turn our
course.’

147. terris: ablative of place without a preposition.

148. effigies: not the appearance but the images of the
gods.

Phrygii=Trojan3 see l. 6.
Penates: see l. 12, note.

150. adstare here=‘ to stand by' ; contrast its meaning
in l. 123. The word is commonly used of visions.

151. †Should in somnis or insomnis be read ‘3 Heyne prefers
the latter, asserting that this was not a dream, because
moonlight is mentioned in l. 152, and in 1. 173 occur the
words nec sopor illud erat. The former argument carries some
weight, for it must be granted that it is at least inconsistent
to introduce material reality into a dream, and it is'Qard to
agree with Page when he says that ‘in a dream you may
surely see things which really exist? The second argu-
ment is more easily disposed of, for sopor does not imply
waking, but simply the difference between a true and a.
false vision (see note on 1. 172). On the whole, the weight
of evidence tends in favour of reading in somnis, especially
as in Homer, and the ancient poets generally, a dream is
so often employed as the medium of divine intelligence.
Conington considers that there is a mixture of dream and
vision, and that the moonlight belongs only to the latter.

manifesti: ί in bodily presence!

152. insertas may mean : (Ι) ‘ set in the wall ' (Heyne), οι·
(2) ‘unbarred ’ (Nettleship following Servius). The latter
would give the better sense, but this negative use of insertas
lacks evidence. The word fenestra is used both of the
aperture in the wall, and of the glazed or unglazed casement
or shutter which admitted the light.

153. Both infinitives are l1istoric; see 1. 141, note.

154. ‘that Apollo will tell thee when thou hast sailed
