140 VERGIL’s AENEID 111

tegumen = temneat.

cetera, ⁴ in all else,’ i. e. probably in language and looks,
or he may have had some Greek weapons. The construction
is that of accusative of respect [τὰ ἄλλα]

595. It is not to be supposed that the Trojans recognized
him as one they had seen in the enemy’s ranks at Troy3
bnt Vergil has here anticipated Achemenides’ history
related ll. 613—654.

in armis=armis inclutus, a use of the preposition sup-
ported by Forbiger by several examples.

597. ⁴ For a little stayed panic-stricken at the sight, and
¹checked his steps?

599. testor-:⁶1 implore you.' This use of the verb is
rare, the ordinary meaning being ‘ 1 invoke as witness‚' in
which sense it occurs in Book ii. 155 υοε, aeterni iqnes . . .
testor.

600. ‘By the gods above, and this light of heaven we
breathe.’ Light is here, as often in the poets, identified
with air. The word is here used passively, but it also
occurs, in late Latin, in an active sense⁷ e.g. viscera spirabilia
z ⁶ 1·espiratory.‘

601. tollite = ‘take on board!

quascumque = quassis or quaslibet, a frequent use in
Livy. So l. 654 quocumque abszmzite leto. Notice the poetical
accusative of motion without the regular preposition.

602. scio = ‘I confess‚⁷ scarcely distinguishable from the
following fateor. Ι know I have no claim to ask, yet 1 do
ask. Valerius Flaccus has copied this use i. 196 Scio we
cunctis e centibus namn Inlicims temptare vias. Observe the
short 0, found in Vergil only in scio and nescio. The later
poets extended this use, at first, eg. in Ovid, to a few words,
afterwards, eg. in Juvenal, to all verbs. Wagner says scio
is a monosyllable.

Danais: an adjective. Compare l. 689 Meam-os.

classibus, according to Nettleship, is used in its old
meaning (ει-1111053 in which it probably recurs Book vii.
716.

603. Notice the omission of the accusative with the in-
finitive; see 1. 201, note.

petiisse : of hostile seeking z: ‘attacked.’

604. nostri ε i. e. of the Greek forces. This is easier than
to imagine it = mei, for all the Grreeks had merited death in
Trojan eyes, and it needed no particular crime on Achae-
menides’ part to expose him to vengeance.
