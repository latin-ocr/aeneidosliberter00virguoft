92 VERG1L's AENEm 111

190. paucis relictis: soine apparently preferred the new
home just obtained to further wanderings. Conington
supposes these few settlers are introduced to explain the
legend that Pergamea was founded by Aeneas.

191. currimus aequ0r=‘speed over the deep.' This use
of an accusative of the direct object after an intransitive
verb is an extension of the cognate accusative. Such
accusatives express the extent of the action of the verb and
are especially common with verbs of motion. Cf. itque
reditque riam ‚- fzcyz't refztyitque vids ; currere cursum, &Q

192. This and the following three lines are a free trans-
lation of Homer, and occur again in a slightly different form
in the fifth book, 11. 841. Observe the use of postquam with
the perfect, the usual construction ; English idiom prefers
the pluperfect. Cf. 1. 57.

nec iam amplius is scarcely to be distinguished from
the much commoner nec iam. Nec goes with the first clause
only, although both caelum and pontus have apparent as
their verb.

193. Observe the emphatic repetition of undique ; compare
saepe . . . saepe in l. 185.

caeruleus, according to Sidgwick and Paga, means

with a sort of metallic lustre.’ It is applied to the sea, sky,
and stars, the woad of the ancient Britons7 the blue eyes of
the Germans, snakes, and cucumbers. It must therefore
include all hues and shades between light green and blue
black. The ancients were not definite in their ideas of
colour, as we sec iu the use of pamm-eus.

195. noctem ε ·' darkness?

inhorruit=⁴ the water shuddered with the darkness.'
Vergil has here, as in so many other places, varied and
elaborated a simple Homeric phrase, ‘the sea became dark
beueath it.' His object was to describe two effects, the
roughness of the sea just before the storm, which is well
described as a shuddering of the waves, and the darkness
which came on simultaneously. But by an artificial treat-
ment he has made the darkness the cause of the shuddering,
for tenebris must be taken as causa] or instrumental, although
both are really effects of the storm. [ulam-ruit contains the
usual idea of bristling, each little wave being represented
as shuddering. Sidgwiek considers that the word expresses
the terror ‹›f the water when it feels the. approach of the
blast. A later poet, Valerius Flaccus, has used the same
