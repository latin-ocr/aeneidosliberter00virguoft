also used, as here, of the gods of a particular town. There
is considerable doubt which gods were Penates, but it is clear
that Jupiter and J uno, Minerva and Apollo ranked among
them, while Vesta (goddess of the hearth and home) was
especially connected with them. Their images were kept
in the innermost part of a Roman house. They are some-
times represented in illustrations as old men with veiled
heads (see Dictioozary of Antiquitz'es). It is a disputed point
whether they were the same as the mayni Di. The Penates
were known sometimes as Dc minores, so that the mayna' Di
may be the ‘Greater Gods.' So Dryden, ‘Our less and
greater gods.’ But it seems better perhaps to take the other
view, and assert the identity of Penates and Di mayni,
especially as we have seen that Jupiter and Juno were
reokoned with the Penates Possibly Vergil intended the

acri. Lyeurgus refused to accept the worship of Diony-
sus, and forced him to take refuge in the sea. Zeus there-
upon struck Lycurgus with blindness. Such is the Homeric
legend, but later poets add further details of the king’s
ferocit .

re{·n=.ta: reque being an intransitive verb ought not
strictly to be used in the passive. Vergil however uses it
twice in the sixth book (in 11. 770, 793); in the second case
with the dative of the agent, as here. This dative must be
taken to be an extension of the use of the dative with the
gerund, and as an imitation of the regular Greek dative
after the perfect passive.

hospitium and Penates are both in apposition to terra,
