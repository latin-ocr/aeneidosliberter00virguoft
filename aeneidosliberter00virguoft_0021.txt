poet, and from the real merit of the work, is that of
John Dryden. It is true that the translator allowed
himself to depart freely—perhaps too freely—from the
original, and that the version at times smacks as much
of Dryden as of Vergil, but the spirit of the translation
falls little below that of the original Latin; ancl. if Vergil
was a master of the hexameter, Dryden was equally
