66 VERGIL’S AENEID 111

21. regi: i.e. Jupiter.
taurum. To offer a bull to Jupiter was a royal sacrifice ;
but it is also said that it was an illegal sacrifice, and there-
fore not likely to have good results. Yet Ovid (Met. iv.
1. 755> mentions a bull as a sacrifice to Jupiter.

22. iuxta is here used adverbially, ‘hard by.’ ‘There
chanced to be hard by a mound, upon whose summit were
copses of cornel wood, and myrtle bristling with thick-set
spear shafts.'

quo . . . summo = z'n cuius culmine, ‘on the top of which.’
The ‘of' in such expressions is expressed in Latin by an
adjective 111 such words as smnmus, imus, medius, totus,
extremus, &c.

23. hastilibus : literally 2 ‘spear shafts’ ς hence boughs fit
to be made into spear shafts. Both the cornel and the
myrtle were frequently used for spears, in which sense
both cornus and myrtus are sometimes employed in verse.
The myrtle, moreover, was sacred to Venus, mother of
Aeneas.

24. viridem . . . silvam, ‘the green w00d‚’ is here used
of a shrub. The idea of thickness of growth is more
prominent in the word than that- of size. &age quotes
other instances.)

convellere: the con· expresses, as often in composition,
‘ completely' ; so confirmare, complere, consolari.

25. conatus is not a finite verb, but a participle to be

taken closely with rideo, ‘after striving . . . I saw.’

ramis: boughs were used to adom the altar. So in
Book ii. ll. 248—9 the rejoicing Trojans wreathed the shrines
of the gods festa fronde.

26. ‘I see a portent dread and wondrous to tell.’ The
so-called supine in —u which is really a verbal noun, is used
(1) as a dative with such adjectives as difficilis, dubius, and
occasionally with nouns, and the verb esse3 (2) as ablativo
with adjectives such as digmus, and such expressions as fas,
nefas, opus est. Vergil employs it freely, but only with five
words, viz. dictu, factu, relatu, visu, victu <R0by).

27. solo : ablative of place whence.

radicibus : ablative absolute.

28. ‘Drops flow with black blood‚' a Vergilian variation
for ‘drops of black blood.⁷ The ablative, which is to be
taken with the verb, not with witae, is one of attendant
circumstances or manner.

29. mihi: closely with membra quatit, almost zanca, dative
of person intel-ested.
