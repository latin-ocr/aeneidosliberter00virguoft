the abs-tract fastus and the concrete iuvenem5 English will
hardly allow of this, and superbwn must be translated as an
abstract noun.

327. servitio: ablative of attendant circumstances. Ser-
ritc'o enim-ae explains tzclinzus; the endurance consisted in
bearing a son while in the position of slave. The son of
Andromache by Pyrrhus was named Molossus.

secutus π ⁴ wooing.’

328. Ledaeam. Hermione was grand-daughter of Leda,
being daughter of Menelaus and Helen. The term ‘a Spartan
bridal,' according to Conington, no less than the epithet
Ledaeam, contains a jeer, as the marriage of Leda’s daughter
Helen with the king of Lacedaemon, Menelaus, had turned
out so disastrously.

329. ‘Passed me on to Helenus a slave, to be a slave’s
bride.’ che is not grammatically necessary, but its use is
justified by the increased emphasis which it produces.
Pyrrhus, tired of Andromache, passed her on to a slave;
nay, more, to be a slave. Papillon well translates, ‘thrall
to th1·all.'

330. inum=Pyrrhus.

ereptae . . . coniugis. Hermione had been, before the
Trojan war, betrothed to Orestes, but his suit was rejected
in favour of Pyrrhus. Coniuqis anticipates facts. So Turnus
(Book ix. 1. 138) speaks of his betrothed Lavinia as coniuge
praerepta.

331. Furiis- - ‘chased by the Furies of his crimes? Sidg-
wiek would write fur iis and translate ‘stung by the madness
born of crime, ’refus ing to personify furiis, because m that
cise α would be usual. But against this it may be urged
that the hunting of Orestes by the Furies was a common-
place, and would be easily understood by all Vergil's readers
or hearers ; and secondly, the omission of α with the agent
after passive verbs is not uncominon in Vergil. Conington
suggests, and the suggestion is no doubt true, that the
personal Furies who punished crime, and the madness ¹
caused by crime, were indistinguishable beliefs. Papillon
follows Conington in meaning, and, like Sidgwick, writes
furiis.

332. ‘Caught off his guard, and slew at his father's altar.’ ·

excipere is not uncommonly used of hunters lying in
wait for game (Page).

patrias . . . ad aras. To make the parallel between the,
fate of Pyrrhus and that of Priam, which Vergil obviously
