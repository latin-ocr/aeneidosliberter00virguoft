110 VERGIL's AENEID 111

proves that Creusa's fate was known. The half-verse must
be left as quite unintelligible.

341. ‘Has the boy, despite all, any love for his lost
mother3 does Aeneas his sire, does Hector his uncle, fire him
at all towards ancient valour and manly spirit? ³

tamen is a pathetic touch3 ‘dead though his mother is.’

amissae: how Andromache received any news of the
death of Creusa, Vergil is not careful to tell us, and it is
useless to inquire.. In such details the poet is quite
careless-

342. ecquid: adverbial accusative with excitat.

343. By ‘his sire, Aeneas,' Andromache means ‘does the
fact (or knowledge) that he is the son of one hero and the
nephew of another rouse the boy's emulation ἒ) '

avunculus: Creusa was Hector’s sister.

347. ‘And knew his friends, and rejoicing led us to his
palace, and shed many a tear at- every word.’ There is no
inconsistency between laetas and lacrimas, for tears may be
a sign of joy, and, mingled with t-he pleasure caused by the
appearance of his old friends, would be sorrow for the losses
called up by the sight of Trojan faces.

348. multum is an adverbial accusative, joined here-—a
rare use—with an object accusative. The construction may
be defended by observing that lacrimas fimdere is merely
a poetical periphrasis sor lacrimare, with which multum
would be quite unobjectionable. Servius points out that
Vergil wisely refrains from putting a speech in Helenus’
mouth, his wife having already said enough to interest
readers.

349. simulata: ‘in the likeness of? Compare Ovid, Met.
xiii. 721 simulataque Troia z ‘a mimic T1·0y'; with the
dative assimulata is more common.

350. ‘A parched stream called by the old name of
Xanthus) Vergil adopted Homer's account of the Xanthus
as an ‘eddying rive1·,’ and contrasts it with its tiny counter-
part. As a matter of fact, the original Xanthus was only
a small stream, except in time of floods.

cognomine: cf. l. 133.

351. amplector: the ancient poets frequently represent >
their characters embracing and kissing inanimate objects.
So the Trojan women embrace the doors ere they leave
Troy. and Medea kisses her bed when about to fiy with
Jason.

353. porticibus. The porticus ran round the aula or arrium, l
and was composed of a narrow walk surrounded by columns λ j
