Vergil has apparently fallen into the mistake of imagining
that it is a word like sellam an instance of falso analogy.
Later poets (e. g. Statius and Claudian) copied Vergil in
this blunder, the latter7 even in the singular: rictrici. ..
solo.

55. fas. This word, used originally of divine law, the dic-
tates of religion, subsequently gained the meaning of what
was right and equitable without any reference to the gods.
Here, however, Polymestor in breaking down the claims of
hospitality and relationship outraged the gods of the family,
and the god of hospstality, so thatfas may well bear its original
meaning, ⁴ brake every holy bond.⁷

56. Notice potitur instead of potitur, although from potiri.
An old infinitive s oti does occur once. Pttztur and potimur
are much more common than the fourth conjugation forms.
So orior frequently makes oreris, ονῐτῑιτ, orimur, while its
eompound (αῖον-ἰω- gives adoritur.

quid: notice the double accusative after coyz's: pectora
being direct object, quid, accusative of extent of action of
the verb, i. e. cognate accusative, especially common with
neuter pronounS. The same words, qnid . . . coyis, are also

put outside the protection os the laws. He might then be
killed with impunity. So we find the legal phrase, sacer esto,
‘ let him be accursed.’ Another explanation is suggested by
Conington (after Forb.), viz. ‘Anything deemed dreadful
by religious feeling, or otherwise terrible or obscure, is
termed sacrum„ especially if it is believed to proceed from
the gods.’ This use is supported by such phrases as sacer
pavor. Notice that Dante took sacra=‘sacred' (Con. . So
Dryden‚ ‘O sacred hunger of pernicious gold? The tale
of Polydorus would appeal to Dido, because she had
been married to Sichaeus, who was murdered by her
brother Pygmalion for his wealth. [So Houson, quoted
by Fuge]

postquam: marks the return to direct narrative, which
had been interrupted by the sketch of Polydorus' history.
Observe that, as usual, the English pluperfect after it
becoxres in Latin the perfect.

58. Notice the alliteration in this and the preceding· line,
