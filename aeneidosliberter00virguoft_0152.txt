142 VERGIL’S AENEID 111

612. This line occurs also ii. 76, where it may be spurious.

613. patria: adjectival, not noun in apposition to Ithaca.

infelicis z not a very exact rendering of Homer’s πολύτλας,
‘much ‘suffering' Notice that for once the deceitful side
of Ulysses’ character is not emphasized.

Ulixi. See note on l. 87.

614. †nomine. Another reading is nomen, which would be
a parenthesis, ‘my name is A.’ Notice the ending in a four-
syllabled word, a Greek ending with a Greek name. The
ablative is that of attendant circumstances, giving the reason
why he went to Troy. So in Book ii. 87 Sinon became
a soldiel at Troy because his father was poor and he must
make a fortune with his sword.

615. utinam, ‘would that my fortune had continued,' i 6
Ι wish I had been satisfied with my lot in life. Papillon
prefers to take it ‘ would that my father’s lot had continued
mme.'

616. The leaving of Achaemenides in Polyphemus’ cave is
peculial· to Vergil, who has otherwise followed closely Homer's
account (od. ix.) of Odysseus’ adventure with the Cyclops.
Hic is explained by the following vasto . . . in antro.

618. domus, ‘a house of gore and bloody feasts, dark
within and vast.'

†sanie : ablative of description, usually found only with
an adjective in agreement, but here justified by the use of
cruentis (for which some MSS. have cruenta) with dapibus.

619. ipse is used of the Cyclops, the master of the house
which has just been described. This use is common in
dealing with the chief person, e. g. master or mistress,
teacher, 810. So we get ipse (lixit2‘the master (of a philo-
sophical school) said‚’ a use which has passed into English.
Catullus says of Lesbia’s sparrow, suam norat ipsam tam bene
quam puella matrem„ ‘it knows its mist1·ess,’ 810. Compare
Greek αὐτός.

620. sidera: the usual exaggeration. For the rest of the
line compare l. 265 (li talem avertite casum.

621. ‘Not easily to be beheld nor to be addressed in words
by any man.’ Literallyt‘Not easy in respect of seeing or
easy of access to any in respect of speech.' The supines in u
(of which Vergil has only factu, relatu, victu, besides the two in
this line) are ablatives of respect here. Cf. l. 26, note.

622. visceribus : not only = entrails, but includes the flesh
generally.

atro : 3 conventional epithet of blood.

623. vidi: repeated for emphasis, l. 626.
