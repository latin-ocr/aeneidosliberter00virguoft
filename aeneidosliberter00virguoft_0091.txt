NOTEs 81

Phrygia, and executed orgiastic dane-es in her honour. In
Rome her priests were the Galli.

aera were the ,cymbals used by the Corybantes in the
processions and orgies of the goddess. Vergil identifying
Cybele with Rhea has confounded Corybantes and Curetes,
the former of whom were Phrygian, the latter Cretan.

112. fida. silentia. sacris. Cybele, like Demeter, had her
mysteries‚ to which only the initiated were admitted and
whose secrets were jealously gual-ded. The phrase is
Vergilian in its suthety, ‘trusty silence sor rites ’=‘ rites
wrapped in inviolable silence?

113. currum . . . subiere instead of the usual subiere z'uyum
= ‘ passed bene-ath the yoke.' Cybele was drawn in a car by
yoked lions, which, according to Lucretius. signified that even
the fiercest beasts must submit to the Universal Mother.
More probable‚ however. is the view (supported by R. Ellis
in his edition of Catullus) that the habit originated in the
fact that as Phrygia swarmed with lions the worshippers
of Cybele soon learnt the art of lion—taming‚ and in Catullus’
time the Galli were the lion-tamers of Rome. The worship
of Cybele has produced from the pen of Catullus the finest
of all Roman poemrs, written in the Galliambic metre,
which has been imitated by Tennyson in Boaclicea.
