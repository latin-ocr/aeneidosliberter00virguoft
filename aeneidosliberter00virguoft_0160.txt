150 VERGJL’S AENEm 111

esse is omitted with ιιΐναιηῃπθ viam. This explanation gives
excellent sense, but appears to me to be open to two grave
objections. (r) Is it possible that Vergil could have omitted
the esse whose absence makes the whole sentence so obscure?
(2) Retro must be taken, not, as one would naturally
suppose, of the last direction in which they have come,
i. e. from the Cyclops' shore—but of the last but one—their
voyage towards that shore. Surely this is at least improbable.

(3) Madvig reads contra ασ, and puts a comma at cursus.
The sense then is ‘In opposition to what Helenus’ bidding
ordained, viz. not to sail between Scylla and Charybdis,
a hair's breadth from death on either hand, we resolve to
sail back.’ Retro must then be applied to a course which
they had not actually taken before, though they had sailed
in that direction. If this use of retro is permissible—which
seems doubtful—the sense is good, but a fatal objection is
the insertion of ac for which there is no authority whatever.

(4) Nettleship suggests taking inter vti-amque viam leti
together, and translates ‘The commands of Helenus warn
us that our course should not make for Scylla and Charybdis,
there being but a narrow line between either way of death.’
This is plausible, but inter seems to go more naturally with
Scyllam atquc Charybdem.

687. angusta: because Pelorum was on the straits os
Messina.

688. vivo . . . saxo, ‘natural 1·ock‚' i. e. not hewn or
assisted in any way by art. The mouth of the Pantagias
forins a small natural harbour. For rivo compare Book i.
167 viroque sedilia saxo. Valerius Flaccus (iii. 422) has
applied this use to water, rim . . . lympha, of a man bathing
111 a river.

689. Megaros: adjective. Compare l. 602 Danais.

iacentem = ‘low lying.’ Compare l. 522 humilem.

690. ‘Such spots he pointed out, as he coasted back along
the shores of his wande1·ings.'

errata: errare, although an intransitive verb, can have a
perfect participle passive, because in the active it admits
a cognate accusative. Conington compares Ovid, Fast. iv. 573
erratas rav-ras, to which may be added Valerius Flaccus, iv. 447
vrratmn . . . orbem.

691. comes infelicis Ulixi : compare l. 613.

692. ‘ Stretched before the Sicilian bay lies an island hard
by Plemurium’s waves' The sinus was the harbour of
Syracuse, which was land-locked by the island of Ortygia,
and the promontory of Plemurium [Πλημμύριον]. This was
