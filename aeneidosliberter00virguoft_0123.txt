outer temple court. It is also possible to consider this to be
an example of hysteron proteron, i.e. the approach to the
temple, although earlier in time than the sacrifice, is placed
after it. If limina is taken to be the temple threshold‚
the sacrifice must have been outside the sacred ground,
which is hardly probable.

372. ipse manu: a frequent Vergilian expression„ often
quite untranslatable into English, intended to call atten-
tion to the action of the agent.

suspensum no doubt refers to the mental agitation of
Aeneas, who is doubtful whether to sear or to hope. I cannot
here follow Page in believing that there is any reference to
Aeneas' walk3 it is true suspenso yraclzc =‘on the toes,' but
to think that Vergil meant to represent his hero as seeming
‘to Walk on air' is almost coniical.

numine: as often, of the presence of the god, empha-
sized by multo as being very plainly felt.

374—6. ‘Goddess-b0rn‚ for that thou farest o’er the deep
with mighty auspices plain is the proof: so does the king
of gods allot the. Fates, and rolls the wheel of change ι such
is the appointed circle.’

nam is explanatory. Helenus before giving his prophecy
explains why he is justified in aiding Aeneas in this way.
It is because he sees the hand of God upon him in his
wanderings that he is ready to reveal all that the Fates and
Juno permit.

maioribus obviously (as Forbiger says)= ‘greater than
usual,’ not with any reference to the (ῑί maiores. The ablative
is that of acconipanying circumstances.

375. manifesta is predicative ; supply est.

fides is here objective=‘ the cause of belief‚’ not sub-
jective = belief.
deum rex: i. e. Jupiter.

376. sortitur, volvit. . . . vertitur. There is here a
mixture of metaphors. sortitur refers to the drawing of lots
by Jupiter, who may or may not be inferior to the powers
of destiny. In volvit the idea is that of a wheel on which
the υἰοεε, changes and chances of this mortal life are
placed to revolve, while vertitur ordo refers to the unchanging
succession of events so revolving. Notice Vergil¹s favourite
alliteration ofv3 cf. 11. 102, 196—7.

377. quo: as usual instead of nt with a comparative in
final clauses.

hospita: originally hospes: ⁶ 3 host' ; then it was trans-
ferred to ‘a guest, or friend,' lastly= ‘a sti-anger: The word
