celebramus must be taken in its litera] sense of ·crowd-
ing‚' although the notion of ‘honouring' is no doubt also
present. Conington says celebramus litora ludis is a variety
for celebramus· ludos in litore.

281. patrias. . . palaestras=‘national wrestling bouts.'
The palaestra [παλαίστρα] was originally the place where the
athletes were trained and exercised in boxing and wrestling
for the games. Hence the word obtained the meaning of
wrestling-bouts. According to Conington it is given hero
as a specimen of other games3 bnt the mention of the
‘slippery oil' proves that the word is strictly used of
wrestling only.

labente: epithet transferred from the body to the oil,
which makes the body slippery.

282. iuvat . . ., ‘what joy to have escaped so many
Grecian towns, and to have held on our fiight through the
middle of the foe?

284. ‘Meanwhile the sun rolls round his mighty year,
and icy winter with the northern blasts roughens the
waves.’ By a ‘year’ Vergil obviously means the space
covered by the sun in a year, and ammam may be trans-
lated ‘ circle‚’ because the Romans connected annus
with annulus, ‘a ring.¹ It matters little whether annum
be taken as cognate accusative (Page, accusative of the
object (Conington), or accusative of motion through (Pa-
pillon .

286.) ‘A shield of hollow bronze, that mighty Abas bare,
I fasten on the door that fronts us, and mark the deed with
this line.’ The clipeus was the large round shield carried
by the Greek hoplite, but superseded in Rome by the oblong
scutum. It was concave on the inside, and was made of
bronze, of ox-hide covered with metal, or of wickerwork
with leather or metal cover-ing it.

gestamen: in apposition to clipeum. Of Abas little is
known. According to Servius he was king of Argos, and
possessed a shield which, after his death, put the enemy to
fiight. This shield was kept in the temple of Hera at Argos.
Was this shield, as Page suggests, taken by some Argive
to Troy, and captured by Aeneas 3 or was Abas some Greek,
not elsewhere mentioned, slain by Aeneas, confused here
with the mythical Argive king? The difficulty cannot
be solved and is of little interest.

287. postibus: presumably ‘on the temple door‚' but
Vergil has not cared to go into details.

carmine: an inscription, such as is to be found on the
