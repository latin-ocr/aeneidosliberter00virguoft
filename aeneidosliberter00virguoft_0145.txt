Herculei: Tarentum was traditionally founded by Taras
son of Poseidon, but colonized afresh by Phalanthus a Lace-
daemonian, and a descendant of Hercules. Heyne suggests

founding of Tarentum by Hercules, with whom South Italy

the Lacinian goddess (Mino). Compare l. 215 Apollo:
Apollo’s temple. Aeneas did not coast round the bay of
Tarentum, but sailed straight across its mouth from tho
Portus Veneris and the Iapygian promontory to the
Bruttian promontory called Lacinian. The temple was
connected by tradition with Hercules, who either killed
a robber Lacinus, or was refused hospitality by a king
Lacinius. Both traditions are given by Servius. Fragments

of the temple still stand, which have given the promontory ἡ

the name of Cape delle Colonne (Forb.).

Papillon points out that although the latter is the more
northerly it would be seen second, as it lies in a bay.
Observe the ending in a four syllabled word which is
a proper name. See Introduction-Matre.

the shore.' Fractas is not to be taken with ad litora, ‘sounds
broken on the shore.' Sidgwick takes fractas of the ⁴ break of
waves,’ apparently meaning ‘breakers,' but probably Page
is right in taking fractus of a broken as opposed to a con-
tinuous sound, describing the alternate roar and silence.
