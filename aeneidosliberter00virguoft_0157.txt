NOTEs 147

or putting that first which should come last, but there can
be no doubt that later editors are right in taking fluuius of
the waves near the shore, and aequora of the open⁷ level
surface of the sea beyond. Polyphemus’ great stature com-
pelled him to wad-„2 beyond the breakers before he could
begin to wash his eye.

663. inde, ⁴ from thence: i. e. with water from the
aequora. Inde is frequently used instead of a preposition
and demonstrative referring to things or persons. Compare
ex avaritia erumpat malacia : inde omnia scelera §liquuntur (cie.
Ros. Am. 27. 7: ; filii dmm inde hunc adoptavi (Ter. Ad. i. 1. 21).
Dryden has a strong line——

‘From his bored eye the gutt'ring blood he laves:

664. gemitu. This modal ablative is rare without an
adjective in agreement, unless the word ean also be re-
garded as instrumental. Compare Book ii. 498 cumulum
viii. 216 clamet-63 v. 200 riris; and yemitu again ii. 323 see
Roby, 5 1239)-

665. fluctus: there is a variant fluctu, which would make
good sense.

666. celerare: historie infinitive, used in animated
language-—especially description—to express aetion without
marking the order of time. Only found in the present
and with such words as odisse, meminisse. <See Roby, ξ 1389.)

667. sic merito: sic refers to recepto. A suppliant who,

having saved us from a collision with the giant, had Ι

deserved to be reseued himself.
incidere: compare rumpere, l. 640.

668. †verrimus, ‘we plough up.' Compare ll. 208, 290.
There is another reading vertimus: ‘ upturn,¹ which Papillon
prefers, and supports by Valerius Flaccus' use of versare in
a like meaning (i. 450).

proni: bending forward for the stroke.

669. vocis is better taken of the sound of human voices,
than of the noise of the oars. The latter is slightly
supported by taciti, 667, but sonitum vocis with this meaning
seems mere repetition. Dryden preferred the other inter-
pretation—

‘The giant hearkened to the dashing sound.’

670. ⁴ But when no power is given him to grasp us, and he
cannot keep pace in the ohase with the Ionian waves.’ The
ordinary meaning of affectare is ‘to strive after‚’ ‘to seek to
obtain.' Here it must mean ‘to lay hold of,’ and Page,
with great probability, considers it a frequentative, ex-
pressing frequent elutehes at the ships. Observe the iu-
