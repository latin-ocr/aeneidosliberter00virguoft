136 VERGIL’S AENEID 111

surs.’ cada are the waters at the bottom which are shifted
from their place, and carry the sand beneath them up to
mingle with the waters at the top (so Page). Miscere, as
usual, of confusion. Sidgwiek well compares Tennyson,
‘The saud and yeasty surges mix.'

558. Supply ait with Anchises. Compare 1. 99 haec Phoebus.

· Of a surety this is the dread Charybdis, these the crags,
these the grim rocks whereof Helenus chanted:

nimirum: not here used, as is often the case, ironically.
illa= ‘ that famous' : ille of celebrity. Haec, hos, deictic.

560. eripite. Supply nos or vos probably the latter, ‘snatch
yourselves from danger.’ Others would supply remos, taking
eripite aszexpedire. This is far-fetehed.

pariter: i. e. in time.

561. haud. minus ac. Compare l. 236, where the same

phrase, with the substitution of secus for minus, occurs,

rudentem, ‘the groaning prow‚‘ literally ‘braying’
No doubt the word expresses the creaking or ‘labouring’
(Sidg.) of the prow as the steersman turns hastily away
from the dangerous spot.

562. laevas . . . ad undas. Compare l. 412 for the turn
to the left, and the repetition oflaewcs.

563. According to Conington remis ventisque is a phrase for
using every effort‚ a variation sor which occurs in remiyio
relnque <plaut As. 1. 3. 5). Cicero too has the phrase, quali-
fied by ut ita dicam.

564. curvato expresses the shape of a huge wave.

idem: as frequently, points a strong contrast. Now we
are tossed to heaven, now let down to the shades.

565. desedimus: the perfect expresses momentary aetion :
‘ In a moment we are sunk.’

566. ter: see 1. 421, note. This line goes with l. 5653
expressing the roaring at the bottom of the sea as they sink,
while 567 is to be referred to 564. This arrangement is an
example of Chiasmus‚ in which the order of the second set
of words is inverse to that of the first set.

567. elisam -* ‘dashed upwa1·ds‚' ex in composition having
often the idea of passing through intervening space: ef.
evadere.

rorantia. : a powerful exaggeration. The clouds of foam
through which the stars appear make the stars themselves
appear to drip.

568. cum expresses simultaneous aetion = ‘ the wind
sank as the sun set) ‘The flagging winds forsook us with
the sun' (Dryden' .
