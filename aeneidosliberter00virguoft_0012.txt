2 VERGIL’S AENEID 111

their victorious troops large grants of land were made
to the legionaries, and Mantua and Cremona suffered
especially. Vergil lost his land, but, thanks to the
intercession of Pollio and other friendS, succeeded in
obtaining its restitution from Octavianus. One of the
friends who aided Vergil in this matter was one whose
name will always be remembered with that of the poet—-

His father and two brothers died before Vergil, but his
mother had married again, and had a son, who inherited
half of his famous half-brother's property.

Except in health Vergil was prosperous‚ and was
