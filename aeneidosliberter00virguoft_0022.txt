12 VERGIL’S ΑΕΝΕῙῙ) 111

without a rival in his command of the ten-syllabled
rhymed couplet.

The following example is from the account of Aetna
and Enceladus, ll. 570—87 :—

‘The port, capacious and secure from wind,

Is to the foot of thundering Aetna joined.

By turns a pitchy cloud she rolls on high;

By turns hot embers from her entrails fly,

And flakes of mountain flames, that lick the sky.
oft from her bowels massy rocks are thrown,

And shivered by the force, come piece-meal down:
oft liquid lakes of burning sulphur flow,

Fed from the fiery springs that boil below.
Enceladus. they say, transfixed by Jove,

With blasted Ilmbs came tunibling from above3
And where 116 fell, the avenging father drew

This flaming hill, and. on his body threw.

As often as he turns his weary sides,

He shakes the solid isle, and smoke the heavens hides.
In shady woods we pass the tedious night,

Where bellowing sounds and groans our souls affright,
Of which no cause is offered to the sight;

For not one star was kindled in the sky;

Nor could the moon her borrowed light supply3
For misty clouds involved the firmament:

The clouds were muffled, and the moon was pent?

Another translation in the same metre was the work
of Christopher Pitt, published in the middle of the last
century. More litera] than Dryden's work, it falls far
short of it in vigour and spirit, as the following passage
will be sufficient to show, ll. 132—46 :—

‘With eager speed Ι frame a town, and call
From antient Pergamus the rising wall.
Pleas’d with the name, my Trojans Ι command
To raise strong tow'rs, and settle in the land.
Soon as our lusty youth the fleet could moor,
And draw the vessels on the sandy shore,
Some join the nuptial hands: with busy toil
Their fellows plow the new-discover'd soil.

To srame impartial laws I bend my cares,
Allot the dwellings, and assign the shares.
