62 VERGIL’S AENEID 111

3. nium and 'l'roia apply here indifferently to the town.
The names were attributed to the ancient kings 1105 and
Tros, of whom the latter was father of the former.

humo, ‘ from the ground.' The city had become a heap
of ruins, from which the snioke rises. Vergil has chosen to
represent the smoke as still rising at the date of his
departure, an exaggeration; but it is impossible to extract
any other meaning from sumac (so Page). Papillon, with
less probability. takes lewm) as ‘on the ground.’

Neptunia, ·the work of Neptune⁷s hands.' The adj.
is emphatic in two ways. The city built by a god might
have been expected to escape ruin, but the word also hints
at the cause of ruin. Neptune (Poseidon) had been compelled
by Jupiter (Zeus) to serve the Trojan king Laomedon f01
wages, and Apollo with him. The king set Neptune to
build his walls, but then cheated him of his reward. This

Italian prince, who had inigrated to Asia. This, however,
15 very unlikely, and desertas must be taken simply to mean
⁴ not yet occupied by other settlers.' It has been objected
that Italy was far from unpeopled⁷ but all that the poet
intended to express was the thought in the minds of the
Trojans, that they must go far from the haunts of men.

quaerere. Notice the infinitive depending on ‹cyimur
to express purpose, instead of the more common supine in
-ιιυι, Τ1115 use 15 chiefly found with ire, currere, venire,
mittere. ’

5. auguriis. The omens referred to must be the three
related in the second book. (1) A flame of fire which
played harmlessly round Ascanius’ head3 (2) thunder on
the left 3 (3‘) a shooting star.

ipsa, ‘just under.’

6. For Antandros and Ιιία see Proper Names.

Phrygiae 15 used loosely for Trojan. The word 15
