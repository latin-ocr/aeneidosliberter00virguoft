NOTES 123

cursus. . . vela vocet is a variation 011 the idea that the
sea. or wind calls the ships, the idea being that all circum-
stances of the voyage seem to be too favoni-able to be lightly
missed.

455. sinus: of the bellying folds of a sail filled by the
wind.

secundos: a transferred epithet strictly to be referred
to the wind.

456. quin follows oze . . . tanti, 11 construction according to
the sense; ne . . . fuerint {cmii = ne tibi obstent. The more
usual construction would be ut 11011.

poscas is in some editions followed by a full stop, but
‚the parallel passage, Book vi. 1. 76 ipsa canas ονο, 15 sufficient
to prove that canat here too must be made dependent on
poscas. The subjunctive is jussive‚ corresponding to an
imperative in Oratio Recta.

457. ipsa. is emphatic. It is to be a special favour to
Aeneas that the Sibyl shall prophesy to him by word of
mouth, and not commit her words to leaves.

459. ‘And how thou shalt 5111111 01· support each toil.’

quo goes closely with modo, with which in prose it would
form one word.

fugias: subjunctive, as being an indirect question.
The -que is disjunctive =‘0r‚’ 115 often.

460. venerata. For the passive use of deponents see 1. 125,
note, 143, &c.

461. liceat. According to Conington the subjunctive is
on the analogy of such expressions as haec habui quae dicerem,
and Sidgwick calls it generic, or indefinite. It seems more
likely that it is reallya confusion of two kinds of conditional
sentence. What Vergil meant to say was, ‘This is all which
I can tell thee,’ but he 11115 expressed it 111 the form of a vague
future supposition, ‘This is all that Ι could tell thee, if I were
to try.'

462. ingentem 15 proleptic‚ that 15 to say, it anticipates
the result of the verb ; see l. 141, note.

†fa.ctis (for which ther(¹ is a variant fatis) goes with ser,
not with inymzt‘em.

463. Do not translate quae at the beginning of a sentenm¹
by an English relative. We break it up into the demon—
strative and a conjunction, ‘Now when? N otice postquam
with its usual tense the perfect, to represent the English
pluperfect.

464. dehinc in the poets is scanned 115 a monosyllable or
dissyllable indifferently. See Vergil, Aemi 131, 256, for dehinc :
