INTRODUCTION 13

When lo! from standing air and poison'd skies,

A sudden plague with dire contagion flies.

On corn and trees the dreadful pest began;

And last the fierce infecticn seiz’d on man.

They breathe their souls in air, or drag with pain
Their lives, now lengthen’d out for woes, in vain;
Their wonted food the blasted fields deny,

And the red dog—star fires the sultry sky.

My sire advis'd‚ to measure back the main,
Consult, and beg the Delian god again,

To end our woes, his succour to display,

And to our wand'rings point the certain way.'

quote Andromache’s speech, ll. 321—43 :—

The Priameian maid,

Who for her dead foe’s pleasure died
Beneath her city’s shade3

Not drawn for servitude, nor led

A captive to a conqueror‘s bed,

While we, our country laid in (lust,
To exile dragged o'er many a wave,
Have stooped to Pyrrhus’ haughty lust,
His infant’s mother and his slave!
A Spartan marriage tempts the youth:

He plights Hermione his truth3

Cast off, to Helenus I fall,

So wills our master, thrall to thrall.

But soon Orestes, mad with crime,
And wroth to lose his promised bride

Smote Pyrrhus in unguarded time,
And at the altar-fire he died.

On Helenus, the tyrant slain,

Devolves a portion of his reign:
