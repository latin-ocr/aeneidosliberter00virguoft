84 VERGIL'S AENEID 111

coynonzirae. The cognomen of a Roman was a family name or
epithet added to the nomen, which specified the qens of the
person mentioned. For example, Scipio was called Africanus.
and this epithet was his cognomen. Now just as the general
derived this name from the name of a conquered country,
so the newly-founded settlement in Crete took the name of
Pet-yamas from Troy, and this name became its cognomen.
For another example of the word see 1. 334.

134. ‘ To love their hearths I exhort them, and to raise
high a roofed citadel.' The infinitive with hortor is a
common use in Vergil in place of the usual ut and subjunc-
tive. See note on l. 32. Another example occurs in l. 144.
‘To love their hearths ⁹ means that the new settlement is to
be looked upon as a permanent home, not a mere resting-
place.

arcemque : litei-ally :⁶ to raise a citadel with roofs‚’ i. e.
raise and roof in a citadel.

tectis is ablative of manner, not, as it has been taken,
dative.

135. fere has caused difficulty, Some consider it quite
unintelligible, while Conington says it refers to this and
the following two clauses, the general idea being ‘that the
new colony was nearly settled. A better view is to take
sere in a limitative sense with iamque = ⁴ about this time,’ i.e.
not insisting on strict accuracy. This use offere is common,
especially with words of number, quantity or multitude,
with omnis, reliquus, ultimus, and similar adjectives, with such
adverbs as semper, and with laic. The expression iamque fere
occurs twice in Book v. ll. 327, 8353 while Cicero uses tum
sere: ‘just about that time)

subductae : supply erant, and compare 1. 2. The opposite
of subducere is deducere, which we have already had in l. 71,
where see note.

litore: local ablative.

136. ‘The youth were busied with marriage, and their
new fields.’ The scansion of conubiis is doubtful. Probably
the ‘ α’ is to be considered long only in arsis, e. g. 1. 319,
conubia Ι serras, in thesis, as here, short, οόηᾰὸῖῖε. Others
would prefer to scau the word always as a trisyllable οῦηᾱὸῇε,
by synizesis, the contractiori of two vowels into one sound,
e. g. ‹iure-6, αἾ-ἰὲίε, quo—ad. The ‘u' is long in nabo, but short in
its compounds omnbus, pronvzzba. The juxtaposition of mar·
riage and farming is to be explained by the fact that they
may be taken as representative symptoms of a settled life.

137. ‘ Laws and houses I was assigning, when suddenly
