NOTES 143

duo . . . corpora. In Homer (Oct. ix. 285-348) Poly-
phemus devours two men at each of three meals.

624. resupinus: probably in its ordinary sense of ‘lying
on his back,’ with the additional notion of ease. But in
Homer the Cyclops sprang up to seize the two men, so that
some would translate ‘ bending back for a spring.'

625. frangeret ad. saxum, ‘brake them in pieces against
a rock.' Homer adds the picturesque touch ‘like whelps,’
to express the power of the monster.

sanie: Homer says the hrain burst forth and wet the
round.
g †exspersa is the reading supported by Servius, and
generally adopted, but the bulk of manuscript authority is in
favour of a less emphatic word adspersa: ‘ sprinkled,’ which
Papillon prefers. .

626. ‘Mine eyes beheld when he chewed limbs reeking
with gore, and the still warni joints quivered beneath his
teethss A good example of forcible description, which is,
however, sui-passed by the horrible detail of 1. 632.

627. †tepicli is clearly more forcible than the other reading
trepidi, which would merely re-echo tremerent, but the latter is
somewhat supported by Ovid's imitation (Met. xiv. 196> Elisz'
trepidem sub (lentibus arius· 'quoted by Conington, who, how-
ever, allows it no weight).

artus here has its original meaning ‘jointsf

628. ‘Not unpunished verily he went; nor did Ulysses Ι

endure such deeds, nor (lid the Ithacan forget himself in
such a peril.’

629. sui: i.e. his reputation for courage and coolness in
the hour of danger z much more emphatic than such a word
as doli : Dryden translates wrongly ε

‘Nor thoughtless of his own unhappy state.’
1thacus is not an adjective in agreement with Ulixes,
but a noun in apposition to it. It is emphatic; ‘the brain
of Ithaca,’ the representative of all wisdom in that island.

630. simul = simul atque : notice the customary use of the

perfect to translate the English pluperfect.
vinoque sepultus, ‘buried in a drunken sleep.’ The
whole phrase, somno vinoque sepultam, occurs Book ii. 265.

631. ‘He let sink his drooping head, and lay in all his

bulk.’
inflexam: i.e. bent forward on to his chest, as he was
too gorged and drunk to hold his head up.

632—3. Vergil has omitted Homer's description oi how
Odysseus made Polyphemus drunk. For the description com>
