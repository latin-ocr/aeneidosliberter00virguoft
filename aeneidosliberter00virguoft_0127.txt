410. digressum: i. e. leaving Italy.

orae: dative after admoverit.

411. ‘The barriers of narrow Pelorus draw apart.’

rarescent is a word implying ‘thinning,’ and probably
here the poet had in his mind the gradual thinning of
a mist. Valerius Flaccus fi. 285) speaks similarly of the
apparent withdrawal of Sestus from its twin Abydos, as
the ram carrying Phrixus and Helle drew near the two
towns, one on the European, the other on the Asiatic side
of the Hellespont.

Pelorum is a headland on the Sicilian side of the sti-aits
of Messina, which, seen from a distance, appears to form,
with the Italian headland on the other side, one continuous
barrier. Then as the ship draws nearer, the strait comes
into sight, which Vergil explains by saying that the barriers
draw back.

412. laeva. (notice emphatic repetition) : i. e. coast along
the east coast of Sicily, and then turn westwards at its

were severed, so men say, whereas either land was one
unbroken tract.' So Valerius Flaccus (i. 589), who often
copies Vergil, describes Italy loosing with tears the land of
Sicily, and the waves breaking in between the hills. Cf.
Tennyson. Passim] of Afflzm· :

‘A land of old upheavn from the abyss,’
and the Scandinavian legend of the separation of Zealand
from Norway: Gefion the goddess tore it from the mainland
with a yoke of oxen.

415. This line is a parenthesis to explain such a marvel by
recalling the lapse of time and its great power. The change
itself may have been gradual or sudden—dissiluisse appears
to point to the latter—but what the poet wished to emphasize
was the fact that, given enough time, any change may be
expected.

416. dissiluisse ι with haec loca, depending on ferunt. The
subject to the latter verb is general, ‘men says or ¹ so runs
