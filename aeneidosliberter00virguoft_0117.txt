, a distinct sentence. But the reproach, if it exists, is not
thus removed, but only postponed to the second half of the
ξ line, and it is quite possible to consider the question as
; caused by pity, not by blame (so Kennedy, Sidgwick, Page).
³ In the absence of stronger manuscript support of the
accusative, the rhythm of the lineis decisive against Coning—
ton's view.

Hectoris is the possessive genitive, not an imitation of
the Greek elliptical use with such words as ‘son‚’ ‘wife,’
ὥσ. Observe the elision of e in Pyrrhin’ before a consonant,
and compare tanton, x. 668, and mortuum, xii. 797.

servas implies duration and fixity, almost = ‘art con-

to the various Greek leaders.

pertulit: as giving the reason of the happiness of
Polyxena, might have been expected to be in the subjunctive,
but Vergil has chosen to emphasize the descriptive rather
than the causal idea of the sentence, and therefore has
preferred the indicative.
