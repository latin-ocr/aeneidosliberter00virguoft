us to thy threshold.'
delato is used instead of a cum clause=c21maezatus eris.
dicturus . . . esi-,za vivid instead of a vague future;
strict logic would require dicat: ⁴ would tell thee.’

155. canit. As oraeles were usually chanted, and in
hexameter verse, the word canere came to mean ‘prophesy.'
So we find carmina = oracles, l. 445.

tua . . . ad limina. How can the Penates who live in
Aeneas' palace be sent to his threshold ἰ) Apparently the
difficulty can only be surmounted by supposing that the
gods were utterly distinct from their images, and that the
Penates lived far off with the other gods. The connexion
between symbol and essence was much confused in the
early religions. Heyne prefers to say that the Penates,

ultro: a very favourite word with Vergil. The notion

Romans generally.

159. imperiumque urbi dabimus, ‘and empire we will
give thy city.' Imperium has a double sense here. It con-
tains both the abstract sense of sovereignty. and a concrete
reference to the actual dominions subject to Rome.

urbi, primarily, of course, refers to Lavinium. but a
Roman reader of Vergil's day would naturally apply the
prophecy more strongly to ‘the city’ Rome.

is purposely left ambiguous, and probably is meant to
include both the gods and great descendants of Aeneas.
Conington would confine the word to the gods, the maym' cli,
possibly the Penates mentioned in 1. 12. Others prefer

the preceding nepotes, a very improbable view. A third
