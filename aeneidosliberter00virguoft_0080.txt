70 VERGIL'S AENEID 111

Dido, who would be ignorant who Polydorus was. Where
Aeneas got his information is not mentioned, and is a
matter of no importance. Vergil has closely followed the
account given by Euripides in the Hecuba.

50. infelix. Does the word refer to Priam's misfortunes
in general, or to his particular ill-fortune in the choice of
a guardian for his son ἰ) Conington takes it in the former
sense, and no doubt the epithet is appropriate enough, and
Priam's woes had become quite a commonplace. But it seems
better to imagine that here the poet is dwelling on one
instance of Priam’s misfortune, and to connect infelix closely
with the verb, ‘ unhappy in his sending.'

furtim, ‘secretly‚' i. e. so as to escape the notice of the
besieging Greeks.

alendum, ‘to be reared.’ The gerundive is constantly
thus used to express purpose, as oblique predicate to the
direct object of the word. This construction is especially
common with curare = ‘to get done!

51. 'threicio regi. His name, as Euripides tells us, was
Polymestor, and he was Priam’s son-in-law. Threicius
[Θρῄκιος] is a poetic Greek form 3 the ordinary prose adjective
was Thracius.

52. Dardaniae: the country used, as in modern Ianguages,
for its inhabitants.

cingi. The expression is not accurate. Apparently
Vergil means to imply that the Greeks had given up the
attempt to take Troy by storm, and were drawing regular
lines of circumvallation round the town. This, however,
is quite foreign to the description given by Homer, indeed,
is inconsistent with much of Vergil’s own account, and
such inethods of investment were not known in the Heroic
Age. Vergil, however, like Shakespeare‚ was not careful of
anachronisnis, but often transferred Roman customs and
military tactics to the days of Aeneas.

53. ‘He, when Troy’s power was broken, and Fortune
retired, cast in his lot with Agamemnon and his triumphant
arnis.'

ille, of course, is Polymestor.
fractae : foi-fractae szmt; see l. 2, note.
'teucrum : for genitive ; see l. 21, note.

54. res Agamemnonias is merely a poetic periphrasis for
Agamemnon. Sidgwick renders it ‘Agamemnon’s standard.’
For Agamemnon see Proper Names. The use of victricia here ·, 33
is extraordinary. The word is an exclusively feminine&
form, and should only be used with nouns of that gender.
