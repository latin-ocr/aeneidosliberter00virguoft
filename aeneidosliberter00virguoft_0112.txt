102 VERGIL'S AENEID 111

272. ‘The crags of Ithaca, Laertes’ realm’ is obviously
a contemptuous expression. Homer frequently mentions
the rugged nature of the island.

‘Rough Ithaca we shun, a rocky shore,
And curse the land that dire Ulysses bore.'—-(Pitt.)

273. altricem: feminine form of altor, used with feminine
nouns only. Compare {senem-ix, effectrix, victrix, διο. For the
genitive Ulia-i see note on l. 87. Observe the use of saevi.
It is rare to find Ulysses mentioned by the Trojans without
some uncomplimentary epithet.

275. ‘And Apollo, dreaded by sailors, comes into sight?
There was a temple of Apollo at Leucate, the south-west
promontory of the island of Leucas, and Vergil must be
referring to this here 3 but the next line as obviously refers
to Actium, where there was another temple to the same
god. Vergil would seem to have confused the two temples.

For aperitur see note on 1. 206.

276. urbi: Actium, the scene of the great battle, B. c. 31,
in which Octavianus, by his victory over Antony and Cleo-
patra, gained the supreme power in the Roman state. The
reference is no doubt intentional, and meant as a compli-
ment to Augustus.

277. ‘ The anchor is cast from the prow, and the sterns
stand along the shore.¹ The ancient anchors closely resem-
bled those still in use, but occasionally had only one fluke.
They were carried at the prow. When a ship was anchored
off shore the prow was always turned towards the sea.

278. insperata: they had not dared to hope to reach
land safely, because they had to pass so many Greek
settlements.

279. lustramur = ‘ we purify ourselvesf A middle use,

< for which see note on l. 47, and Appendix. The meeting

with the obscene Hal-pies had rendered purification neces-
sary. Jupiter is specially mentioned here because the
Harpies were his servants, and the prophecy (l. 251) had
come from him.

votis, ‘and with offerings we set the altars ablaze.’
Votum is here used not of the vow but of the offering vowed.
So even the wooden horse is called votum by Petronius.
For the use of incemlerez‘to make a fire upon ⁹ compare
Book viii. 1. 285 incensa αῖίανία.

280. ‘And throng the Actian shore in Ilian games.' ·

The reference here is obviously to the games founded at
Actium by Augustus· in honour of his victory over Antony
and Cleopatra. They wer(¹ held at intervals of five years.
