90 VERGIL'S AENEID 111

173. sopor is a translation of a Homeric word (ὄναρ), mean-
ing an untrue dream, a vision in which no faith is to be
put. Others would press nec sopor to mean that Aeneas was
not dreaming at all, but saw a waking vision. This is
improbable, as has been already pointed out, l. 151.

illud refers to the whole state or chain of circumstances
described. Illa would have been more natural, but Latin
preferred to make the pronoun agree with the nearest
noun. Cf. laic labor, hoc opus est.

174. velatas : i. e. ‘crowned with fillets,’ a frequent
method of representation of the Penates, for which see l. 12.

175. gelidus . . . sudor: a descriptive touch. A cold
sweat is often the result of an impressive or terrifying
dream.

a use common even in prose with totus, medius, &c.

178. intemerata, ‘undefiled,’ combines the meanings of
‘unmixed ¹ (wine), and ‘plue’ ‘choice.'

focis : the altar of the Penates. Focis is probably local
ablative, but it may also be a dative of the recipient, a case
frequently used in Vergil.

honore z ⁴ due honmge‚' expressed in a material form,
i. e. ‘sacrifices Compare the use of honor = (Ι) ‘ office' ; (2)
‘ the official who holds office.' Summus honor (Juv.) = ‘ consul.’

179. certum: a poetic variation—-found also in Plautus—
of the prose certiorem βιοῖο.

ordine: i. e. preserving the order of events, telling the
vision exactly as it appeared.

180. 'He recognized the doubtful offspring and the two
sires? Anchises now grasps the ambiguous meaning of the
oracle, which had been so worded as to be capable of pointing
either to Dardanus and Italy, 01· to Teucrus and. Crete, as
