NOTES 131

Observe the spondaic ending with a Greek word. See
Metrical Introduction.

518. ‘When he beholds that all is calm in the clear sky?

constare = ‘to be settled,' i.e. 119 saw no reason to
expect a change from his inspection of the storm and rain
bringing constellations.

519. The ‘clear sign’ was probably not a torch, but a
call on the trumpet.

e puppi seems to imply that Palinurus had stayed on
board, and if so, the second view of 1. 510 is strengthened.
On the other hand, 11 is quite in Vergil's manner to neglect
all mention of so small a detail as his return 10 1119 ship.

castra movemus: a military metaphor, not to be
pressed.

520. velorum. .. alas: probably a genitive of definition 3
the vela being that of which the alae consist. [So Conington,
Page.] See 11. 293, 477, notes. Heyne, however, took it as
=⁴ the ends, or cornel-s of the sails,’ and Nettleship supports

- this view by a passage of Sallust, quoted by Servius, velorum

alis remissis.

522. obscuros: ‘hazy.'

humilem=the low shore of Italy.

523. Observe the emphatic repetition of Italiam. This
one word expressed so much to the TrojanS. It meant, as
they thought, rest from toil, and a fixed settled home.
Hence the name was on the lips of all.

525. cratera corona. induit. The Romans were in the
habit of wreathing their wine-cups with garlands at a feast.
Homer however frequently speaks of ‘erowning the cups
with drink' in the sense of ‘filling fulls and Vergil may
have had this idea in his mind. Compare Book i. 724 rina
coronant.

527. ‘Standing on the lofty poop.’ The puppis was the
part of the ship on which stood the image 01· images of the
tutelary gods of the vessel to which libations and prayers
were offered. So in Book x. 171, we hear of a ship with
a bronze statue of Apollo on the stern. There is another
reading, prima, the exact force of which is difficult to see.

528. This line is intended 10 be exhaustive of all 1119 gods.
The genitives depend 011 potentes, which word, in the sense of
‘powerful in,’ is also occasionally joined with the ablative.

529. ‘Grant us a course. smooth before the wind, and
breathe a favouring gale.’

ferte must be taken aszclate‚ but, no doubt, there is
a reference to the use offero aszwafting (l. 473).
