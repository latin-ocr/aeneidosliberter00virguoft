112 VERGIL’S AENEID 111

362. ‘Come speak, for religion has given me favourable

presage for my whole voyage.’

prospera. must be taken quasi-adverbially with dimit.
It may be ranked as a case of transferred epithet = dixit
prosperum cursum. See 1. 281, note.

363. suaserunt . . . petere. This use of the infinitivo
with suadere and persuadere, although (for metrical reasons)
most common in verse, occurs also in prose, instead of the·
usual ut and subjunctive.

364. repostas: syncopated form of repositas: ‘ remote.'

365. dictuque nefas. The use of nefas in this passage is
unexampled in Latin. Elsewhere it is an indeclinable
noun, but Vergil has here treatedit as an adjective :nefandum.

366. prodigium, like monstrum, is used of what is, or

367. obscenam. =‘hideous‚’ literally ‘ill-omened.' See

but as an ordinary hypothetical subjunctive, with the
protasis contained 111 sequens :quid si sequar?

369. hic—-hereupon. '

de more: a constant phrase in sacrificial rites. Accord-
ing to Papillon, Vergil was anxious to recommend to the
Romans the old practices of religion which Augustus desii-ed
to restore. See l. 65.

370. ‘Implores the favour of thc gods and loosens the
fillets of his holy head, and to thy shrine, Phoebus, with his
own hand leads me awestruck by the fulness of divine
presence!

pacem: as in the phrase pace tua, ‘without any offenee
to you.’ The hair was unbound by those who expected to
