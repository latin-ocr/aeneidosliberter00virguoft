152 VERGIL'S AENEID 111

700. fatis. Servius tells us that the inhabitants of Camarina
applied to the god to know whether they should dry a marsh
lying near the town—the modern Lago di Camarana. The
answer was, μὴ κίνει Καμάριναν, ἀκίνητος ’γὰρ ἀμείνων, ‘touch
not Camarina, untouched 'tis better.’ In defiance of the
oracle, however, the marsh was drained, and the town
captured by the enemy, who marched over the dry ground,
where the swainp had been.

702. ‘And Gela, called after the name of its furious stream?
This line presents several difficulties t (Ι) Is immanis nomina-
tive or genitive? If the latter it refers not to the size, but
to the dangerous character of the stream, which is said by
Ovid, Fasl. iv. 470, to be full of whirlpools. If nominative,
it is open to the objection that Gela was a small town, and
that to refer immanis to the character of the tyrants of the
town is very forced. Heyne suggests that immanis refers to
the ox with human face on the coins of the town. (2) The
lengthening of the ‘a’ in Gela is very strange. (3) The geni-
tive of nouns in ‘ius’ and ‘ium’ in Vergil is generally not
“ti ' but ‘22' Conington, however, quotes Lachm. on
Lucretius to the effect that the uncontracted genitive was
allowed in trisyllables. Person suggested fluvio and took
coqnomz'ne as an adjective.

704. magnanimum. This is the only adjective in Vergil
with genitive in -um for -ονιιυι, See 1. 21, note.

quondam, ‘in days of old.’ The horses of Agrigentum
and a victory won by the tyrant of that place are mentioned
in Pindar. This took place between 488—472 13.o., so that
Vergil is guilty of an anachronism, but there is no need on
that account to try and force quondam to mean ‘some day in
the future,' sor Vergil was not careful of anachronist and
to mention these Greek colonies as existing at the time of
the siege of Troy is only as absurd as for Shakespeare to
represent the Greeks at the same siege discussing Aristotle‚
or for Dumas to mention characteristics of Oliver Cromwell
described by Shakespeare.

705. palmosa, ‘rich in palmS,’—not the date, but the
dwarf palm,—according to Nettleship. with which the dis-
trict abounded, as Cicero points out in the Ver-riwes (v. 33. 871,

706. ‘And thread the shallows of Lilybaeum difficult with
hidden reefs.⁵ (lura = difficilis.

707. inlaetabilis, ‘joylessf Servius says it was joyless‚
because of the loss of Anchises there, but it seems more
natural to interpret th(¹ word as a reference to the low and
unlovely coast line.
