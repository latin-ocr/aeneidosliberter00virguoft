124 VERGIL'S AENEID 111

v. 722, for dehinc. The length of the τι 111 qravm is quite unparal·
leled in Vergil, but it is said that in Ennius and the old Roman
poets the α of the neuter plural was always long. Papillon
compares triqt'nffl, and Sidgwick postea, αηεεᾶ, which latter
examples⁷ however, Roby treats as ablatives. ‘ Heavy with
gold and cut ivory,’ i. e. presents richly adorned or worked
with gold and ivory. The presents were partly of gold,
partly of ivory; but all alike were heavy. Page follows
Long in referring elephanto merely to plates of ivory used
for inlaying. Notice the Greek ending with a four-syllable
word, especially common when, as here, the word itself is
Greek. Compare 11. 328, 680.

465⁴ imperat: with infinitive common in verse, being
metrically convenient, but in Cicero only found in the
passive. The usual prose construction is ut with subjunc-
tive.

stipatque carinis ingens argentum, ‘packs in the hulls
silvei· plate of great weight.' A variation on the usual stipat
carinas amento, Carinis is local ablative.

466. The oracle of Dodona in Epirus was said to contain
vessels whioh all resounded if one was struck. The lebes was
a deep vessel or basin used either to catch the water poured
over the hands and feet before and after a meal—such were
often prizes at gaules—or, as a kettle to boil meat (Dictionmy
osAntz‘qm’ties).

467, ‘A breastplate woven together with links, and triple
with gold‚’ i.e. a breastplate with triple links of gold. An
example of hendiadys‚ the hamis being really the same as
the auro. The licia was a leash used in weaving, joining
alternate threads, so that they could all be lifted together
to allow the passage of the shuttle. Where two leashes were
used the material was called billa-7 where three, trilix (Dictionary
ofAntz'quities .

468. ‘And the peak of a noble helm, and flowing erest!
Another varintion for ⁴ a helm conspicuous with a peak and
flowing erest? The Greek orest was of horsehair, the Roman
of feathers.

469. Notice the use of sua. =‘his own‚’ i.e. ‘those that
suited him.’ Suus is often used thus⁷ not of the grammatical,
but of the virtual subject of the sentence. It = pater habuit
sua dona.

470. equos: for which Epirus was celebrated, Geory. i. 59.

duces: not drivers for the horses, but guides or pilots
for the voyage. So Dryden z
‘Supplies new pilots and new sweeping oars.'
