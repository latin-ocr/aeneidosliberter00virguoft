14 VERGIL'S AENEID III

Who calls the realm beneath his hand
From Chaon's name Chaonian land,
And crowns the 11111, 111 sign of power,
With Pergamus, our Dal-dan tower.
But you—what destiny from heaven,
What stress of wind your bark has driven
Unknowing on our coast?
And lives he yet, whom once at Troy—-
Ascanius? dwells there in the boy
Grief for his mother lost?
Feels he the hereditary flame
His growing spirit fire
At Heetor’s and Aeneas’ name,
His uncle and his sire ‘?’

'The last translation to be mentioned. is that of
William Morris, written in fourteen-syllable rhymed
coupletS‚ one line of English answering to one line of
Latin. This remarkable version, of whose enduring
popularity it 18 yet too early to speak, is above all things
the work of a true poet, and combines scholarship with
poetic spirit. If it has a fault, it 18 that the long, some-
What heavy line, and the anthol-'s love for employing
archaia and Scan'dinavian diction, hardly represent
happily the even, stately flow of the Vergilian hexameter.

We quote from Achaemenides’ account of the Cyclops,
ll. 616—38 :-
