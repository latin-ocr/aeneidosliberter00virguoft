NOTES 77

Thymbraee: an epithet of Apollo, to whom there was
a temple at Thymbra in the Troad. Aeneas chooses this
title to recall to the god his connexion with Troy.

86. genus: i. e. ‘descendants’

mansuram: as opposed to the old Troy that had proved
not lasting.

serva . . . Pergama, ‘save the second citadel of Troy.'
By ‘citadel' of course Aeneas means himself and his
followers, by whose labour the new Pergama must be built.

l’ergama. (neuter plural) was the citadel of Troy ; later
writers use the word generically for a citadel (Con).

87. ⁴ All left by the Greeks and ruthless Achilles.’ Notice
the genitive, which is an imitation of the Greek.

Achilli is an irregular genitive, as if the nominative
were Achilleus instead of Achilles. So in 1. 273 we get Ulixi.
Horace uses a genitive Achillei, and Lucan an accusative
Achillea. The line from reliquias occurs also in Book i. 1. 30.

88. quem sequimur is a more vivid form of the delibera-
tive subjunctive, ‘whom do -we follow. Ψ ‘whom are we to
follow ‘?’ Instances of this· 111 Vergil ale not uncommon: cf.
l. 367 quae prima pericula Tito? Another explanation is
possible. Aeneas takes it for granted that there is divine
guidance over him, but wishes to know who is the divine
guide. The tense will then carry its usual force. This
however does not suit the following words so well as the
filst explanation.

89. pater: often used in addressing the gods. ⁴ Give us
an omen, father, and glide into our hearts,' i. e. inspire us.
Inlabor in prose is followed by a preposition and the
accusative.

90. For vix see 1. 8, note.

visa. Supply sunm see l. 2, note.

91. Notice the lengthening of the -que before laurus. This
(as has been pointed out by Nettleship in an Excursus to
Book xii) is an obvious imitation of the Homerie use.
Sixteen instances occur in Vergil, and in fourteen of these
the -que is lengthened before a double consonant. The one
in the text is 0116 of the two exceptione, and is supported by
the fact that the following letter is a liquid, before which
Homer frequently lengthens a short vowel. The remaining
instance precedes a ε, The temple of Apollo at Delphi,
which Vergil had 110 doubt in mind when writing these
lines, was decorated within and without with the god’s
sacred tree, the laurel.

92. mons: i. e. Mount Cynthus, which rose above the
