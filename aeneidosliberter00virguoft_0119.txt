intended to mark, exact, the words should mean ‘in his
own house,’ i.e. at the altar which stood in the middle of
the dwelling; but, according to tradition, Pyrrhus was
slain at Delphi, where there was an altar to his father.
Euripides follows the latter tradition.
333. morte is a tempora] ablative; cf. nocte, (lie, mane.
reddita. = ‘given as his due’; for ¹che soree of re see
1. 170, note. It is hard to see, however, how Helenus could
be said to receive any part of Pyrrhus’ kingdom as his
due. Conington therefore supposed that re z ‘in succession’3
but the use of the word lacks support.
For cessit see 1. 297, note, ‘passed to.’
334. qui.. .‚ ‘who by an old name called the plains
Chaonian, and all the land Chaonia, from Trojan Chaon.’
Chaon, according to Servius, was a companion of Helenus,
but the name Chaonian was much older, and indicated a part
of the Pelasgic family 111 Epirus.
For cognomine see 1. 133, note.

337. tibi marks the change on Andromache’s part from
explanation to question. By qui renti, quae fata, she means
to ask whether Aeneas’ presence was accidental, and due to
pressure of weather, or whether he had been directed to the
land by fate.

338. appulit is a nautical term, ‘to bring a ship to land.’
Compare Book i. l. 377.

. 339. quid. Some such verb as facit must be supplied. We
should say, ‘What of the boy Ascanius?’ Compare Georq.
iii. 258 Quid iuvenis?

superat : equivalent to superest: ‘ to survive.’

vescitur aura: a Lucretian phrase (Lucr. v. 857 vesci
vitalibus auris), found also in Book i. l. 546 si rescitur azo-a
Aetherea. Vergil implies that the air is the source of life, so
that there is no need to follow Munro in taking vesci 2 ‘use’ 3
but we may translate ‘ feeds on.'

340. This half-line is remarkable as being the only one in
Vergil in which the sense is not complete. At least three
attempts (given by Conington) have been made to finish
the line. (11 peperit fumante Creusa ; (2) obsessa est enim
0reusa; (3) natum fumante reliqui. Wagner and others, fol-
lowing the reading of some inferior MSS„ read quae for
quem, and trans late, ‘does she live who to thee when Troy

.' They suppose that Andromache is about to 1··efe1 to
Creusa, but sees from some look οι gestum of Aeneas that
she* is dead This explanatio‚n which might suit a t1·1gedy‚
‘is out of place in epic poetry’ *XPage)‚ and the next line
