writers; the beauties of Lucretius-outside his system,
the passion of Catullus, the graceful art and sparkling
wit of Horace, have made, and will make many admirers,
but to the majority Vergil is always the master poet.

It remains to point out in what the magic of Vergil

Vergil. His language is often artificial, even affected,
yet the most affected passage invariably leaves the im-
