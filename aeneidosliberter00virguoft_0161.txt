NOTES 151

the scene of the great battles between the Athenian and
syracusan fleets which resulted in the utter defeat of the
former.

693. undosum is merely a Latin translation of the Greek
word Πλημμύριον = ‘ the place of tides ’ [πλημμυρίς]. Compare
l. 516 pluvias Hyadas, l. 698 staqmmiz's Helori (stagnum z ’έλος
= ⁶ a marsh ’ and 1. 703 (ιν-(111113 Acragas (ἄκρος : ‘ high ’). The
modern name of Plemurium is Punta di Gigante = ‘Giants'
Point.’

:nomen . . . Ortygiam: compare 1. 18 Aeneadas . . . nomen.

694. Alpheus, the river of Elis in the Peloponnesus, was
pursuing his beloved Arethusa, when Diana (Artemis)
transformed her into the fountain Arethusa, which fiowed
underground and undersea to Ortygia, where it reappeared.
Alpheus continued his pursuit, and his streams were mingled
with hers. Compare Ecl. x. 4—5 z

Sic tibi, ciem fluctus subterlabere Sicanos,
Doris amara snam uon intermisceat undam.

695. From Alpheum to mare is in Oratio Obliqua: at qni
Oratio Recta is resuined.

696. ‘At thy spring, Arethusa, blends with Siciliam
waters.’

ore . . . tuo: ablativo of place.

697. Notice the unusual metre. The poets seldom allowed
the second foot to be composed of one whole word, except in
the case of such words as nescio (quisi, and *inter se). Vergil,
however, has ceddam cerea prima, and Catullus, sed conubia
laeta.

iussi may refer to some order of Anchises not other-
wise mentioned, but Page prefers to take it of the iuss«
Heleni, while Servius suggests it may refer to Achaemenides.
The first is most likely, it being Anchises' work throughout
to see to auspices and religious observances generally.

698. exsupero z ⁶ pass by? The simple supero is not
lincommon in this use. Valerius Flaccus has imitated
this use in ii. 622-3:

Iam. [uqa Percotes Parimnqm» infamesrayosis
lca-superant Pityamque radis.

699. Pachyni radimus. In l. 429 we find metas- lustrare
Pachyni, so that the meaning of radere here. viz. τ ‘ to grazej
is to be looked upon as a metaphor from the chariot races in
which the turning-point (meta) was grazed as closely as
possible, in order to obtain the inside station for the 1-1111
up the straight. Valerius Flaccus has imitated Vergil, Book
v. ll. 107-108 alla (mamma raditur.
