10 VERGIL’S AENEID 111

A spondaic ending, i. e. spondee in both the two last
feet, is rare in Vergil, although common in Greek and
in Catullus.. In this case the fourth foot should be a
dactyl ; e. g.

‘Nereidum matri et Neptuno Aegaeo’ (1. 74),

and
‘armatumque auro circumspicit Oriona’ (1. 517).

(The hiatus in the first example is noticed in the notes.)

The verse usually ends with a word of two or three
syllables, butVergil occasionally, for purposes of emphasis,
allows words of one syllable at the end, and—especially
in Greek words—we find words of four or more syllables
in this position; e. g.

‘litoreis ingens inventa sub ilicibus sus’ (l. 390),

and

‘Lyctius Idomeneus: hic illa ducis Meliboei' (1. 401),
‘Ledaeam Hermionen Lacedaemoniosque hymenaeos ' (1. 328).

Occasionally an elision occurs of a vowel at the end of
a verse before a vowel at the beginning of the next; e.g.

‘quem non incusavi amens hominumque deorumque?
aut . . ,⁹ (ii. 745—6);

but as a mle, no such elision takes place3 e. g.

‘sed tibi qui cursum venti, quae fata dedere?
aut . . .’ (11. 337—8).

Other exceptional instanees, such as hiatus, and the
lengthening of a short vowel in arsis, will be noticed in
the notes as they occur.

The chief features of Vergil's verse are: (1) the variety
of his lines; (2) his adaptation of sound to sense.

Both these will be understood after reading a page
of text, and need not be mentioned here in detail. I
merely add two or three famous instances of the latter.
