NOTEs 65

meaning is more appropriate to terra, the former to socii,
which seems to hint at the relation of ‘guest-friends.'

16. fuit: the perfect is rare with dum, but (as Sidgwick
observes) ‘it is always possible when the emphasis is on
the fact, not on the duration.' Compare Book i, l. 268 <lum
res stetit Ilia reque. It is perhaps better to print Fortuna with
a capital, and so personify it.

feror: as in l. 11.

litore curvo: ablative of place without the usual
(prose) preposition; often found with such words as rure,
parte, dextra, laeva, terra marique, in prose ; verse of course
amplified the use.

17. prima=‘ the beginnings ofmy walls.’

fatis: i.e. ‘having landed with unfavourable fate.'
A reference to the inauspicious portent of Polydorus which
followed. Ablative of attendant circumstances.

18. Aeneadas, ‘sons of Aeneas,' the name of the men of
the town, not of the town itself, although it is not impossible
to take the latter view. No town in Thrace so named is
known, but there was a place at the mouth of the river
Hebrus called Aenus; this town, however, was mentioned
in the Iliad, and so was prior in date to Aeneas’ voyage.
Nettleship suggests that there may have been two legends
of the founding of Aenus.

19. Dionaeae matri, ‘my mother, daughter of Dione';
i. e. Venus, who is called Dione’s daughter in Homer.
Other traditions named her Mother Euonyme, or Hemera,
or she was said to be sprung from the sea-scam.

divise ⁶ the other gods ' ; z et ceteris (lis.

20. auspicibus, ‘to favour the work begun.' The word is
used proffiptically, that is to say, it anticipates the effect of
the sacrifice, which would be to render the gods favourable.
There is here, no doubt, a reference to the Roman custom
of taking the auspices before beginning a work. So the verb
auspicari, literally, *to take the auspices,' comes to mean
‘ to make a beginning.’

nitentem ε either of colour, ‘pure white,’ or of condition,
‘sleekf We know from Homer that victims offered to the
gods were fat.

21. caelicolum. ⁴ Notice the genitive. It occurs
mainly: (1) in compounds of colo and ῃίῃηος (2) in weights
and coins, e. g. mmmms3 (3) in distributive numerals,
e. g. binum3 (4) in names of peoples, e. g. Dcmaum; (5) in
a few nouns and adjectives, e. g. vir, liberi, clem, juber, socius,
maynamnffls (Roby).
