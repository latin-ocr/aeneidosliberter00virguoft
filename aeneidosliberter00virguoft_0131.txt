NOTES 121

441. cumaeam . . . urbem = Cumae.

accedo is usually followed in good prose by acl or in with
the accusative, but the. simple accusative is common in
Tacitus and the poets, while Ovid frequently employs the
dative.

442. ‘Avernus’ haunted meres and rustling woods! For
the lakes with their supposed connexion with the under
world see l. 386, note.

lacus et Averna. must be taken as a hendiadyS, see
l. 223. Averna is an adjective to which loca must be supplied,
‘the Avernian region.¹ Vergil uses the same plural form:
Book vii. 1. 91 (mis . . . Arernis.

sonantia silvis: a Vergilian refinement on sonantibus
silris. silvis is an ablative of respect.

Such are the persons mentioned. l. 452, who have to go away
without an answer. The Sibylline books were no doubt
