146 VERGIL'S ΑΕΝΕΙΙ) 111

in rank than the servus, for he retained his nomen, cog-
nomen, and tribe, and could become a free man (not a
‘fi-eedman’) by cancelling the debt.

654. hanc = meam.

potius: i.e. better to die than stay where 1 am, in ,

dread of such a horrible fate as overtook my comrades.
quocumque ἡ quolibet or quot-[s. Compare l. 601.

655. vix: on the various constructions possible after *circ
see l. 8, note.

656. ipsum: as in l. 619, used of the master, here in con-
trast to his flocks. This is better than to take it, with Page,
of the sight of Polyphemus in contrast to Achaemenides’
description of him. The heavy spondees of the line express
the slow, heavy gait of the monster.

658. ‘A monster grim, shapeless‚ huge, reft of sight?
The spondaic line with its elisions is obviously intended
to express the idea of uncouth bulk. Those who connect
z'nqens with lumen, instead of with monstrum, weaken the
line greatly. Lumen is better taken of the light than of
the eye, although the latter is possible, and supported by
Conimton.

659. trunca manu pinus = ‘ a pine lopped by his hand?
Manu is instrumental, not local ablative, Vergil’s object
being to emphasize both the bulk of a giant whose staff
was a pine. and the strength displayed in the prepara-
tion of such a staff. To translate mame ‘in his hand' omits
the second of these ideas. There is another reading manum,
which seems scarcely natural. Even Vergil’s love of varia-
tion of expression could hardly make the staff guide the
hand. The object to reqit is probably eum (Polyphemus),
but it can be taken with restiyt'a, ‘diret-ts and assures his
steps?

660. ‘His one delight, and comfort of his plight.‘ The
line 5661115 to be intended to be pathetic‚ although pathos
is rather out of place in connexion with the cannibal
monster. Notice the attraction of ea (for ecte) to the gender
of its apposition: compare the famous line, Hic labor, hoc opus
est. So l. 714 Hir· labor . . . haec meta..

661. Various attempts have been made to complete this
half line, as (le collo ‚fistula pendet: pemlebntfistzcla collo : dependet
fistula collo. They are all unknown to Servius, and the men-
tion of the fistula points to a later form of the legend of
Polyphemus.

662. ‘After he had touched the deep waves, and come to
the sea.' Conington took this as an instance of ὕστερον πρότερον,
