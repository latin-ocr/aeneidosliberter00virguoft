96 VERGIL’S AENEID 111

216. ‘Maiden faces had the birds, foul exceedingly was
the issue of their bellies, hooked their talons, and ever
gaunt with hunger their looks.' Notice the alliteration of
v (as often& it cannot 06 imitated in English without
some loss to the force of 1116 11116, ‘maiden were the faces
of 1116 fowls‚ filthy that which flowed from their bellies.’

217. uncaeque manus: i. e. they had talons, not hands.

218. It is said that Vergil on his death-bed ordered his
executors, Varius and Tucca, not to put any finishing
touches even to the lines which he had left unfinished.
Whether he would have completed these lines, if he had
lived longer, we can only conjecture3 in many cases it
is hard to see how anything could have been added without
weakening the effect, in one or two the line has been filled
up in a manner not unworthy even of Vergil himself.

219. delati: literally=⁴ carried down‚' i. e. from the open
566 to the shelter of the harbour. The harbour was
apparently regarded as lying lower both than the sea and
the shore, hence we find deducere: ⁴ bring down from shore
10 566,’ 1. e. launch.

220. laeta: ‘abundant' The word is constantly used in
Vergil in reference 10 116105 and omps, of fertility of 1116
soil, fatness of cattle, abundance of farm produce, milk, 816.
No doubt 1116 idea 15 transferred from the owner who
rejoices in his prospersty, to the material cause of that
prosperity. The same idea occurs 111 1116 Old Testament:
compare ‘sheep bring forth thousands and ten thousands
in our streets z happy are the people that are in such a 6656.’

campis ι local ablative ; in prose, in would be required.

221. caprigenum may be either the neuter singular of 611
adjective, or the genitive plural of εαρνίρεηα, for which see
l. 21, note. The phrase is 6 reminiscence of the old Roman
tragedians Pacuvius and Accius.

nullo custode = ablative absolute or ablative of attendant
circumstances. The Latin tongue lacked greatly a present
participle of esse.

222. clivos = ‘the other gods,' distinguished from their ruler.

223. in partem praedamque= ‘ to share the spoil.’ This
is an excellent example of hendiadys, i. e. expression of
6 compound idea by the use of two expressions not sub-
ordinated but coordinated. The Romans used to vow a
portion of the spoil to the gods before advancing to battle,
65 Livy (quoted by Forbiger) tells us.

224. ⁶ We pile up couches and banquet on the rich feast?

toros is here used of piles of turf, which at the
