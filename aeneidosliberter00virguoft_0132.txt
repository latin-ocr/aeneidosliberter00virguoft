122 VERGIL'S ΑΕΝΕΠ) 111

yet.’ It may be either feminine singular, referring to the
Sibyl, or neuter plural with carmina. In either case its
force is the same: it points out the difference between the
care with which the prophecies are at first placed in order,
and the negligence which suffers them to be blown about
by the wind, and does not trouble to restore them to their
places.

448. cardine : although usually translated ί hinge‚’ the cardo
was not at all like the modern hinge. It consisted of a pivot
and socket hy means of which a door was made to open and
shut. Pivots were fastened to the top and. bottom of the
door-leaf, while sockets were let into the door-sill and.
lintel for the pivots to turn in (Dictionary of Antiquities).

449. ‘ And the door flutters the light leaves.' The door is
represented as doing what is really the work of the wind.
The whole phrase is slightly artificial, for Vergil seems to be
endeavouring to render dignified what can only be a very
homely circumstance.

450. deinde == ‘ thereafter.’

cavo .. . saxo: of the cave.

452. ‘Unadvised they depart, and hate the Sibyl’s seat.'

inconsultus literally means ‘unconsulted,‘ in which
sense Livy uses it of the Senate, whose opinion had not
been asked. A more common meaning (found in Cicero) is
‘inconsideratc,’ ‘indiscreet.’ In the present line it can
only imply ‘without receiving advice‚' a use not found
elsewhere, but supported (according to Nettleship) by the
use of consulo -- oncum, with the accusative.

odere is expressed co-01·(linately. but really is subordinate
in meaning: hatred of the Sibyl was the effect of receiving
no answer, ‘depart with hatred in their hearts.’

453. ‘Here let no loss of time be of such value in thy
sight—albeit thy 001111·fides chide, and thy voyage calls thy
sails mightily to the deep, and thou canst fill thy canvas
with favouring winds—that thou dost not draw near the
prophetess, and with prayers demand that herself she chant
her oracles, and in gracious wise unseal her voice and lips!

morae . . . dispendia. =‘loss consisting in delay‚' the
genitive defining the meaning of dispendia.

tanti is locative, expressing value or amount at which.
This consti-uetiam is common with the words tanti, quanti,
mccfflm', mulli, parri, nihili, flocci, lazones, assis, boni, and the
genitivos pluris, minoris, which are duc apparently to false
analogy (Roby).

454. vi: ablativo of description.
