98 VERGIL'S AENEm 111

tectosque, ί and hide their swords in concealment here
and there in the grass, and bury their shields in ambush!
Τροίας and. latentia are both used proleptically, expressing the
result of the action. See l. 141, note. The dis in disponunt
implies ‘ in different places.' The idea of hiding is strongly
emphasised by the number of words bearing this sense.

238. delapsae: i. e. swooping for a third attack, the first
beginning at l. 225, and the second ll. 232—234.

curva: a customary epithet. Many adjectives in the
ancient poets were attached generically to nouns, without
any specific reference to the facts of the case. So in Homer
a hero’s chief characteristic is mentioned with his name
when there is no notion that it is displayed in some
particular passage. So Achilles is ‘swift of foot‚' Odysseus
‘wily,' Hector ‘manslaying,’ and the like. So ships are
‘curved,’ the sea is ‘wine-dark‚’ διο. Vergil often imitates
this use.

240. aere cavo, ‘the hollow bronze,' i.e. the trumpet.
Compare the use offerr1cm=‘the steel' (i. e. swords, δια),
and of aurum for golden vessels, rings, coined money, δῖα,

240-241. ‘My company charge, and cssay a strange con-

nova. = ‘unusuaL' the way in which the conflict was
unusual being explained by the following infinitive, which
as a verbal noun is the direct object of temptant, and in
apposition to praelia ε ‘a conflict,’ ‘the marring.‘

obscenas, like (lira, l. 235, is a word drawn from the
language of augury, implying unfavourable omens. ‘Among
almost all the ancients things, which were held to be of
ill-omen, were called obscena? [Paul. ex Fest.‚ p. 201.]

pelagi: the Harpies, according to Hesi0d‚were daughters
of the ocean nymph Electra..

243. sub sidera, ‘up to the stars’3 merely a poetical
phrase for ‘upwardsf not to be pressed literally. So
Vergil speaks of people in prayer stretching out their hands
towards the stars, i. e. heavenwards.

246. infelix: yet another word of augury. Infelix is of
course the opposite of felix, ‘that which brings ill-luck,
unpropitious ’ ; ⁴ prophetess of evil.’

rumpit . . . vocem: a Greek phrase affected by Vergil,
with whose love for inversions of ordinary language it
agreed. ‘Makes these words break from her breast?

247—248. ‘War too for our slaughtered kine and slain
steers, children of Laomedon, is it war ye prepare to wage,
