minores = ‘younger generation.’ Compare maiores =
⁴ ancestors,' and mein maior and minor.

166. ducis: i.e. Italus, a mythical personage.

gentem: observe the race used for the land.

167. propriae: ‘ abiding.’ Cf. l. 85, note. ⁴ Hence sprang
Dardanus, and father Iasius, from whom came our rac-e!
There is a genealogica] difficulty in these lines. The usual
tradition is that Iasius was son of Zeus and Electra, daughter
of Atlas, and consequently brother of Dardanus. As to his
fate, one tradition states that Zeus slew him on account of
his love for Demeter ; while according to another he went
from Italy to Samothrace, where he was instructed in the
mysteries, and finally passed to Asia Minor. In the present
passage Vergil seems to represent Iasius as the father of
Dardanus, and Sidgwick and Papillon consider that he
has varied the usual story ; while Conington seems doubtful
what view to take. But Book vii¹ l. 219 Dardanus is
mentioned as son of Jupiter. and this seems conclusive
evidence in favour of the view (supported by Page) that
pater is used vaguely with reference to a distinguished
ancestor. Yet this only meets half the difficulty, for α quo
can only refer to Iasius, while it ought undoubtedly to refer
to Dardanus. Of this difficulty no explanation worthy of
mention has yet been adduced.

168. nostrum: notice that the gods speak as Trojans.

169. laetus. The reason for joy is explained by haud
dubilamla; no longer could there be doubt as to the future
home of the exiles3 a plain direction is given, and aimless
wandering should cease.

170. haud: as usual, negativing a single word.

refer: the re in this word may have two meanings:
(1) ‘in return '; (2) ‘agaim’ of restoration to a proper or
normal state. Hence refer is not ⁶ carry back,' but ⁶ carry as·
is due or proper.’ So 7·eclcle7·e=‘to pay what is due,' while
redire often has the meaning of returning to favour which
has been lost, and ought to be retained. Compare resipiscsre
=⁴t0 come to one's proper self’3 revalescere=⁶to get back
one’s proper health‚' Sec. So requirat implies the search for a
land with which connexion should not have been broken off.
The subjunctive represents an imperative of direct speech.

171. Ausonias—Dictaea: see Proper Names.

tibi: obviously Aeneas, not Anchises.

173. ‘No empty dream was that, but methought I saw
their eountenances, face to face, and crowned looks aud

features before my eyes·.⁷
