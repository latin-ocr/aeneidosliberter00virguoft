Ι. Life of Vergil.

PUBLms VERGILIUS MARo was born on October 15,
13.c. 70, during the consulship of Pompey and Crassus.
His birthplace was Andes— the modern Pietola- a village
near Mantua, in Cisalpine Gaul. Of his parents little is
known. His father appears to have possessed a small
estate, and is said to have made money by buying land
cheap—probably at the time of the Sullan proscriptions
—and by hee-keeping. Of his mother we only know that
her name was Maia. His father was not blind to the
advantages of educati0n‚ and sent his son to school at
Cremona, where he assumed the toga virilis at the age
of fifteen. Subsequently he studied at Mediolanum
(Milan), and at Rome, where Syron an Epicurean was
his master in philosophy. After finishing his education
Vergil seems to have retired to his farm, his health not
permitting him to aspire to fortune by a military or
oratorical career. Soon after he made the acquaintance
of Asinius Pollio, who was legatus in his province, and in
41 B.C. found this friendship of great value. Octavianus
—afterwards known as Augustus—and Marcus Antonius
had defeated the remnants of the Republican party
under Brutus and Cassius at Philippi, 13.C. 42. To reward
