 

PREFACE

ἥ,-

Ι HAVE endeavomed, Whenever possible, to ex-
press in the notes my acknowledgements to the
various authors whose editions have been most
useful to me. But I wish herc to acknowledge
the great assistance Ι have received from the
various editions by Messrs. Page and Conington,
and—to a smaller extent —from those of Messrs.
Sidgwick, Kennedy, and Papillon.

In an elementary book, such as this, references
to Heyne, Wagner, Forbiger, and other continental

editors are naturally scarce.
