NoTEs 153

708. †The MSS. are divided between actis and actus, the
former being the more strongly supported. With actis the
meaning is, ‘after passing through so much buffetting and
so many trials, Anchises died when the end of trouble
seemed at hand? With actus we must understand it to
mean, ⁴ 1 had already undergone so much, and now came
the worst blow of all, my father’s death! fessum, in 1. 710,
supports the latter view.

711. erepte: vocative by attraction, instead of nominative,
owing to the presence of parer optime.

712. eum: probably concessive, ‘although’

713. hos . . . luctus, ⁴ a sorrow such as this.’

714. labor extremus : Conington points out that the death
of Anchises so dwarfs all other calamities that Aeneas forgets
his subsequent shipwreek at Carthage.

meta: the turning-point of the race home.

715. vestris, ‘to you (Dido) and yours?

716. intentis. Compare Book ii. 1. Ι, where the listeners
are described : intentique ora tenebam.

718. ‘At length he ceased to speak, and here made an
end, and rested.' Vergil was fond of repeating the same
idea in different ways, so that there is no need to adopt the
prosaic view that quierit means ‘retired to rest.’ Still <as
Sidgwick suggests) the word is in contrast to the approach-
ing tragedy of Dido. Dryden's ending is very tame—

‘Thus‚ to the listening queen, the royal guest
His wandering course and all his toils expressed:
And here concluding, he retired to rest.'
