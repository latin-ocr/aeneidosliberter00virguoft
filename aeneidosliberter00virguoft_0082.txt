72 VERGIL’s AENEID 111

portents.' There is an obvious reference here to the Roman
custom of referring the prodigies to the senate, and primum
may imply that Anchises acted as president of the council.
But it is not necessary to believe that primum means any-
thing more than that Anchises was first asked his opinion,
and 1 cannot see, as Page does,that ‘ the position of the words
privmmnque parentem is fatal to this view.’

59. sit: indirect question depending on posco.

60. The infinitives excedere and dare depend upon animus.
In fact it is almost a case of apposition‚ the infinitive having
its original force as a verbal substantive, ‘leaving the land
is the decision of all!

animus (est) is not unfrequently used with such an
infinitive‚ e. g. Book iv. ll. 638-9‚ we get sacra Iovi Styyio . . .
perficere est animus, So Ovid says (Met. v. ll. 149—150) Omnibus
unum opprimere est animus. The construction in animo esse,
with the dative and infinitive, is common in prose.

61. †1inqui (for which there is another reading linquere,
of poor manuscript authority) is used merely for the sake of
variety, and depends grammatically upon the notion of
order or advice contained in omnibus idem animus.

pollutum hospitium, ‘the scene of outraged hospitality.'
It is hard to decide in which of the meanings of hospitium
(i. e. ‘ hospitality‚’ or ‘the place of entertainment,' mentioned
in the note on l. 15) the word is here used, but possibly the
second, which emphasises the idea of place, is to be preferred.
Sidgwick, however, who translates ‘the friendship defiled‚'
seems to prefer the other meaning.

dare classibus Austros: a Vergilian refinement upon
the ordinary clare vela Austris. The fieet is represented as
eagerly waiting for the wind which would enable it to
leave the accursed spot. Austros =‘ south winds‚' are merely
particular-ized to satisfy the Roman love of definiteness. In
this case it is unfortunate, as a south wind would not take
the fleet in the direct-ion in which it actually sailed, i. e.
southwards.

62. instauramus τι celebrate ' or ‘ solemnize.' The word
was used of renewing rites, sacrifices, &c.‚ which had been
unsatisfactorily or improperly performed at first. Polydorus
had been buried (sepulto, l. 41), but it was not to be expected
that his murderer had celebrated the important rites required
at burial, and these the Trojans now performed. The chief
idea of the passage is not ‘ new’ rites‚ but proper, ceremonious
performance of those already hastily celebrated. Notice the
various uses of funus: (Ι) funeral rites ; (2) the dead body;
