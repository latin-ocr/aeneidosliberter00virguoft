to Poseidon whatever first met him, if he reached Crete
in safety. He was met by his son, whom he sacrificed in

the story of Jephthah and his daughter, and the tale of
Beauty and the Beast.

122. Idomene-a: a Greek accusative. Of. Ilionea, Capanea.

leg-imus. The meanings of this word are all closely
connected together. They are as follows: (Ι) ‘to collect,’
