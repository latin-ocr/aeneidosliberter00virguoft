128. ‘ There rises the shout of sailors in varied rivalry!

nauticus . . . clamor, according to Conington, is to be
interpreted of the cry of the boatswain giving time to the
rewers, and vario certamine of the efforts of the latter. Page,
with much greater probability, would refer clamor to the
sailors' cheers as they start racing for the island which is
to be their home. Vario will then imply that the ships
were racing one against the other in small squadrons, not
all in one large body.

129. hortantur is used almost as if middlez‘ encourage
one another‚’ not, as usually, actively of a leader encourag-
ing his men. Then petamus must be taken as the words of
the sailors: ‘Comrades exhort comrades, crying, “Let us
make for Crete and our ancestors.”’ Others would put
a colon at socii, and consider petamus to be an oblique sub-
junctive, ‘bid us seek’ (so Sidgwick). Conington gives the
spirit of the words well in his rendering, ‘For Crete and our
forefathers, ho ! '

130. prosequitur. The word is used equally of friendly
and hostile following, but here it obviously bears its
technical sense of escorting a parting guest.

a. puppi, ‘asterus A very common use of the pre-
position meaning ‘ on the side of.’ So we find a srzmte=⁸ in
the van,’ ‘in front ⁵ ; a lateribus: ⁴ on the flanks '; a temo:
‘in the rear.⁷ So firmus ab equitatu: *so far as cavalry was
concerned.' Closely connected is the use of ab to describe
work assigned: 0. g. sert-us α ῃεαίὺῑιεε 'a lackey ¹ ; ab epc'stolis ;
(ι rationibus.

131. curetum: see ll. 104 and 111. notes.

132. avidus is to be taken with molior. Observe that
adjectives expressing gladness, willingness, eagerness, and
their opposstes, are much more common than their adverbs.

optatae. Conington explains this as a reference to the
Roman custom of choosing a site with auspices ; for which
compare 1. 109, note. This view seems better than that of
Page, who would connect optatae with azidus =‘eagerly
desired‚' because Vergil is much addicted to introducing
Roman customs into his descriptions.

difficulty or effort. See l. 6, note.
