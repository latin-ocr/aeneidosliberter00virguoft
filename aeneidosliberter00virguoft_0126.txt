116 VERGIL’s AENEID 111

Grais: dative of the agent, for which see note on
l. 14. Here it occurs with the present, usually it is found
with the gerundive and perfect passive.

399. The Narycian Locrians, after the death of their chief,
Ajax, son of Oileus, settled on the shore of Bruttium, to
which they had been driven by a storm.

400. milite =‘soldiery.’ Compare the use of pedes for
infantry, eques for cavalry, levis armatura for light-armed
troops.

401. Idomeneus: see 1. 122. ‘Here the famed town of
the Meliboean chief, tiny Petelia, resting on Philoctetes’
wall.’

meliboea. was a Thessalian town, the king of which,
Philoctetes, on his way home from Troy was driven by
the storm on to the Bruttian coast, where he founded
Petelia.

402. parva. is said to explain the name Petelia, which is
derived from an archaic word, petilus = ί thiu? Virgil men-
tions this little town because it had won fame by a gallant
although unsuccessful resistance to Hannibal.

403. steterint, ⁴ shall be moored,' lit. ‘ shall have stood’ 3
stare being used as equivalent to sisto (intransitive) =‘to
stop] in fact NVagner says that steterint is from sisto, not
from sto.

405. velare: imperative middle=‘veil thy head: See
note on 1. 48, and Appendix. It has been suggested that
velare is infinitive active used (as in Greek) for imperative,
but the only authority for this construction is a passage in
Valerius Flaccus, which is capable of easy emendation.
Vergil is endeavouring to provide an explanation for the
Roman custom of praying and sacrificing with the head
covered.

406. An ill-omened sight or word was enough to destroy
the efficacy of a sacrifice.

in = ⁴ during‚' or ‘in the midst of.'
honore =‘worship.'

408. ‘This sacrificial rite let thy comrades and thyself
observe, and pure in this holy use let thy descendants abide.’

On teneto see l. 388, note. .
409. casti = pii (Conington).
manere, in this sense of ‘abiding by,' is common: com-
pare manere in sententia, in voluntate. in mentm so sometimes
without the preposition: cf. Vergil. Aen. ii. 160 Tu modo
promissis maneas.
nepotes: i. e. the Romans os Vergil’s day especially.
