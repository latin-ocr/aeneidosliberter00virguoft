NOTES 67

30. gelidus . . . sanguis, ‘my blood is chilled and freezes
with dread! Gelidus is closely connected with coit, the
former giving the idea of cold, the latter of closeness, which
together make up the idea of freezing.

31. ‘ Again of a second also I proceed to pluck the pliant
twig, and probe to its depths the hidden cause 3 of a second
also, black is the blood that follows from the bark.' Observe
the repetition of alterius in ll. 31 and 33, obviously intended
to emphasise the occurrence of a similar result.

lentus is a word with a wide scope. Originally, it
means ‘flexible,’ ‘tough.’ From this come its various
seoondary 'meanings of ‘tenacious‚’ e. g. lentius visco: ‘ more
tenacious than birdlime '3 ‘sluggish,¹ e.g. lentus asinus;
‘tedious,’ e. g. neyotium Ientum3 ι(’()1(ἰ,’ ‘indifferentf e. g.
lentissima pectora. The infinitive, convellere, depends on
insequor, a construction common in Vergil, who extended
the use of the infinitive after verbs of desiring, trying‚
and beginning to verbs of effort‚ and purpose, such as
insequor, insto, impello, ardeo, suadeo, tendo, &o. This construc-
tion was partly due to the very free use of the infinitive
in Greek, and to the great metrical convenience presented
by the infinitive 1n comparison with other moods,

32. pen1tus=³ inwardly‚ to its depths,’ hence ‘completely’

temptare: a word used of exploring. So in Book ii.
l. 38 we get temptare latebras of the Trojan horse.

33. † ater: there is another reading, alter, but the text is
defended by the presence of (tiro in l. 28.

34. movens: used of mental activsty, ‘much ponder-
mg.y

Nymphas . . . agrestes: the Nymphs of the country
are named because they had the trees under their protection,
whence their Greek names of Dryades and Hamadryades
[6p135=0ak]. To be distinguished from these were other
classes, such as the oreades or Mountain Nymphs, and the
Nereides and Naiades of the sea and river respectively.

35. Gradivum: a surname of Mars. The ‘a' may be either
long οι· short, but the former is much the more common.

Geticis: a tribe near the mouths of the Danube, used
inaccurately by Vergil for Thracians. For Mars and Thrace
see l. 13 Mavortia.

36. *Duly to make the portent propitious, and lighten
the omen ' (Page). The subjunctive, spumam-ent. is really
dependent on venerabar = ‘I worshipped with prayer that
they.’ It is an example of the jussive subjunctive, and
represents an imperative of direct speech.
