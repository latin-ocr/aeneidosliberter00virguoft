106 VERGI L's AENEID 111

longo . . . tempore = post lonyzcm tempus.

310. ‘ Is it a true form, a true messenger thou dost appear
to me‘?’ Prose would probably haye required vera facies,
serus nuntius to be accusatives in agreement with τω but the
poet, no doubt from metrical considerations, has preferred
to make the appositions agree with the subject of affers.
Vergil uses a similar construction in Booki. 314 mater sese
tulit obz' za: obviam sese.

311. aut. . , ‘or if kindly light has left thee, where is
Hector‘?' Light was in Latin, and even more in Greek, the
sign of life3 so that lux can be used almost as a synonym of
τίΐα. So to be void of light=‘ to be dead,' and m Greek ‘to
see the light,' frequently=⁶to live.' Notice the variation
‘light has left thee,’ for ‘thou hast left the light? Aeneas
was so constant a companion of Hector that Andromache
wonders that if they are dead they should be parted.

313. vix . . . , ‘scarce to her wild sorrow do I answer in

315. ‘I live indeed, and drag out life through all utter
calamities.’ Ducere is a common metaphor from spinning,
but here the mimia ameum form the frame through which
the thread is dragged.

316. †There is a variant fides for rides, which would give
a good sense, fides being used of that which will stand the
test of scrutiny by the senses.

317. deiectam: ‘ fallen? The metaphor is kept up in the
words casus, ⁶10t,⁷ literally ‘falls and excipit, ‘ catches‚'
‘receivesj although the latter word has also its frequent
sense of taking in succession, as in 1. 210. Hector‘s position
was so high that Andromache must have fallen, whoever
was her next husband.

318. revisit. A question mark must be put here. ‘What
lot that is worthy of thee has found thee ⁶? ’

319. ‘Andromacha wife of Hector, dost thou still abide

as Pyrrhus' wife ‘? ' This rendering, according to Conington, y

implies an unfeeling reproach to Andromache, and there-
