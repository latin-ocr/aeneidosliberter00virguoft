however the infinitive is not strictly one of purpose, but is
the direct object to wit.

684. This and the following two lines are among the most
difficult in Vergil, and it cannot be said that any really
satisfactory explanation has yet been given of them.
Possibly they are not genuine, or, as Nettleship, following
an interpretation of Servius’ note on the passage, seems
to believe, a line has dropped out after 684. This, however,
is mere conjecture, and the lines must be taken as they
stand. The chief views on the subject are the following :—
(1) Conington translates, ‘on the other hand the injunctions
of Helenus warn us not to hold on our way between Scylla
and Charybdis, either passage a hair's breadth remove from
death τ so we resolve on sailing back again? That is to say,
the Trojans in their dread of the Cyclops, at first sail away
before a south wind, in a direction which would take them
straight to the Straits. Then they remember Helenus¹
warning of the even greater peril to be met with from
Scylla and Charybdis, and determine to risk the Cyclops in
preference. Fortunately at this moment the wind shifts
into the north, and they continue their original voyage
in safety. Accepting this view various explanations are
necessary.

utramque viam must be an accusative in apposition to

cursus, οι· to the whole sentence, and must be considered ῃ

a Vergilian inversion of the natural expression, ·Either
side of the passage was perilous.'

ni must be taken as=oze, a form found in inscriptions
and once in Catullus, and supported by the analogy of nisi,
nimirum, quod πί, quippe πί. The difficulty of teneant instead
of teneamus Conington surmounts by supposing that it was
not Aeneas but his companions who were alarmed, and that
they took matters out of his hands. This explanation seems
weak in the last-named point, but otherwise is feasible, and
is probably the best on the whole. Sidgwick and Papillon
accept this view. (2) Page (who lias a long and interesting
note on the passage) translates, ‘On the other hand stands
in warning the command of Helenus “Between Scylla
and Charybdis the path on either side is within a hair’s
breadth of death, if ye fail to hold your course”: ’tis
resolved therefore to sail back (along our former track).’ He
explains this by saying that, when they remember the
prophetie warning of Helenus, the Trojans resolve to turn,
i. e. so as to retrace their course along the south coast os
Bruttium, Helenus' words are put in Oratio Obliqua, but
